<h2>STORIES OF THE SAINTS<br />
BY CANDLE-LIGHT</h2>

<h3>NINE DAYS IN CAMP, AND NINE STORIES
BY CANDLE-LIGHT</h3>


<h3><span class="smcap">About this Book</span></h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time there were fifteen Cubs who spent
nine wonderful days in camp. They were London
Cubs, and the camp was on a beautiful little green
island whose rocky shore ran down in green, tree-covered
points into the bluest sea you ever saw.
These nine days were the most splendid days in those
Cubs' lives. And so they often think of them, and
dream about them, and live them over again in
memory.</div>

<p>So that they may more easily go over those days
their Old Wolf has written down all about them in this
book. Perhaps other Cubs will like to come away, in
imagination, to that fair, green island, and so have a
share in the nine days.</p>

<p>Now, one of the very "special things" about those
days in camp were the candle-light stories which the
Cubs listened to every night, seated in a big, happy
pile, pyjama-clad, on their palliasses. All day they
used to look forward to those stories, and sometimes,
in the middle of a shrimping expedition, or a paddling
party, one or another would remark, "Story to-night,
boys!" and turn his thumbs up to show he was pleased
at the thought. And so you will find the candle-light
stories, too, in this book; and remember that all the
stories in this book are <i>true</i>&mdash;both those about the
Cubs and those about the Saints.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE FIRST DAY</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> train steamed slowly out of Victoria Station.
"Now we're off!" shouted a Cub, and he and all the
others began to jump for joy, which was not easy in a
railway compartment packed like a sardine-tin. Then
someone began to sing the Pack chorus, and everyone
joined in with all their strength:</div>

<div class='poem'>
Let the great big world keep turning,<br />
Now I've joined a Wolf Cub Pack;<br />
And I only know<br />
That I want to go<br />
To camp&mdash;to <i>camp</i>&mdash;to <span class="smcap">camp</span>!<br />
Oh, I long to set off marching<br />
With my kit-bag on my back.<br />
Let the great big world keep on turning round,<br />
Now I've joined a Wolf Cub Pack!<br />
</div>

<p>Then someone yelled "Are we down-hearted?" and
the Cubs yelled "No!" so loudly that Akela thought
she would be deafened for life.</p>

<p>Presently the train ran out into the country, and
plodded along between woods and fields. And the
early morning sun shone brightly, and the sky was
very blue. The country, the country! And, very
soon, the sea! There were some of them who had never
been to the country, and "Spongey," the youngest of
the party, had never even been in a real train.</p>

<p>"Talk about <i>hot</i>!" said someone, panting, when the
train had thundered on for about an hour. And, my
word, it <i>was</i> hot! Besides, there were blacks and dust,
and everyone began to get very grimy&mdash;specially the
people who were eating bread-and-jam and sticky
fruit, and the people who had to crawl under the seat
to pick up things that had got lost.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Akela, "we shall be in the sea
this evening, and then we shall be cool."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>That started everyone jumping for joy again, of
course.</p>

<p>Presently the train passed Arundel Castle&mdash;its white
towers and turrets and battlements rising up amidst
the dark green woods like an enchanted castle in
the days of knights and fairies&mdash;and the Cubs learnt
that there are castles in real life as well as in story-books.</p>

<p>After that they began looking out of the window to
see who would be the first one to catch sight of the
sea. "Bunny" was the first to, and his friend Bert,
the Senior Sixer, came a close second.</p>

<p>At last the train got to Portsmouth Harbour, and,
shouldering their kit-bags, the Cubs ran down on to the
steamer.</p>

<p>The harbour was thrilling: battleships, cruisers,
torpedo-boats, the Royal yacht, the Admiralty yacht,
and, most interesting of all, Nelson's ship, the <i>Victory</i>.
As if the steamer knew that a crowd of eager Cubs
were longing to see all round the <i>Victory</i>, it went out
of its way to steam right round it, slowly and quite
near, and the Cubs had a splendid view.</p>

<p>The boys all wanted to be the first to <i>touch</i> the sea,
but Bunny, who had <i>seen</i> it first, forestalled them again,
by letting down a ball of string over the edge of the
boat and pulling it up all wet.</p>

<p>At last the ship reached the Isle of Wight, and the
Cubs and their great mountain of camp luggage went
down the long pier. I forgot to tell you that besides
Akela there was the Senior Sixer's father and mother,
who were coming to help look after the camp&mdash;they
became the "Father and Mother of Camp"; and
there was also a lady who was a very kind camp
Godmother. The grown-ups and the luggage were
soon packed into a large motor-car, and then, relieved
of their kit-bags, the Cubs set out to walk the two
miles along the sea-front to the village called Sea View.
The way lay along a thing called a "sea-wall"&mdash;a high<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
stone wall about six feet broad running along above
the shore, with the sea lapping up against it at high
tide. Along this the Cubs walked (or rather ran and
jumped), their eyes big with wonder at the great
stretch of blue, blue sea, with here and there a distant
sailing-boat, and, above, the sky even bluer than the
sea. "I didn't know the sky <i>could</i> be so blue!" said
a Cub; and that was just how they all felt.</p>

<p>It was very hot walking in the midday sun. There
was no hurry&mdash;nine days to do just as they liked in&mdash;so
halfway along the sea-wall the Cubs and Akela
scrambled down some steep stone steps on to a tiny
stretch of sand not yet covered by the incoming tide.
Boots and stockings were soon off, sleeves and shorts
tucked up, and everybody paddling deep in the cool
green water.</p>

<p>When they had all got thoroughly cool they went on
their way, and at last arrived at the Stable.</p>

<p>This was where they were to sleep. It consisted of
a courtyard, a couple of stalls, a coach-house, a shed,
and two tiny rooms. Akela occupied one of these, and
the Cubs were divided into two groups. The Stable
was in charge of Bert, the Senior Sixer, and in his stall
he had Bunny (a Second), Dick (a big Cub very nearly
ready to go up to the Scouts), and Patsy, a small
but lively Irishman. Sam, another Sixer, had in his
stall four young terrors&mdash;Terry, Wooler, Jack, and
"Spongey" Ward. Then there was the coach-house.
This was in charge of Bill, the last Senior Sixer, now
a Cub Instructor. The other occupants were Jim,
a Sixer (Bill's young brother), "Mac," a Second, two
brothers, "Big Andy" and "Little Andy," and a
rather new Cub called Bob.</p>

<p>It took a good while to stuff the palliasses with
straw and unpack. But when this was finished everyone
had a good wash and changed into cool old clothes&mdash;shorts
and cotton shirts. Tea followed, in a jolly
old garden behind the bake-house. There was a seesaw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
in it, and the grass was long and soft, and the
shade of the apple-trees very cool. Then the party
ran up the hill to the camp field. Here there was a
lot to do: the bell tent to be pitched, the fireplace
made, wood to be chopped, water fetched, all the pots
and pans unpacked, a swing and a couple of hammocks
to be put up, the two great sacks of loaves to be fetched,
and, oh! a hundred other things. But all the Cubs
set to and did their best, and at last all was ready.</p>

<p>"Now for the shore!" said Akela, and everyone
cheered and ran for their towels and bathing-drawers.
It was only a few minutes' walk down to the most
lovely shore you can imagine&mdash;stretches and stretches
of golden sand and little, lapping waves. On one side
you could see rocky points running down into the
greeny-blue sea, with trees growing right down to the
shore. An old, brown-sailed coal barge moved slowly
past on the gentle wind, the many browns of its patched
sails forming a rich splash of colour in the evening sun.
The Cubs soon turned into "water babies." Boots
and stockings had been left behind at the Stable, and
now they got rid of clothes as well. How cool the
sea was! That first bathe seemed to wash away all
the heat and smoke and grubbiness of dear old
London.</p>

<p>After the bathe came a splendid paddle among
brown, sea-weedy rocks, and the Cubs caught their
first baby crabs and found their first shells, and got just
as wet as they liked.</p>

<p>But the sun was sinking down behind the grey line
of sea, and the clock there is inside every Cub was
telling supper-time. So, with hands full of sea-weed
and shells, they made their way back to camp.</p>

<p>The camp-fire was burning merrily. "Godmother,"
in a large blue overall, was stirring a steaming dixie
of cocoa, and "Mother and Father" were cutting up
bread and cheese.</p>

<p>After supper there was time for a little play in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
field. Then, as it began to get dusk, a whistle-blast
called the Cubs in for night prayers. It was still quite
light enough to read, so each Cub had a little homemade
book of Morning and Night Camp Prayers.
Kneeling in a quiet corner of the field, with just the
evening sky overhead, with a pale star or two beginning
to appear, it was easy to feel God near and to
pray. The camp prayers started with "A prayer that
we may pray well." It was a very old prayer, really,
but it seemed just to fit the Cubs, and help them to
<i>do their best</i> in their prayers as in all other things.
The prayer was this: "Open Thou, O Lord, my mouth
to bless Thy Holy Name; cleanse also my heart from
wandering thoughts, so that I may worthily, devoutly,
and attentively recite these prayers, and deserve to
be heard in the sight of Thy Divine Majesty. Through
Christ Our Lord. Amen." Then followed the "Our
Father" and some short prayers. And after that the
Cubs said altogether: "I confess to Almighty God that
I have sinned against Him in thought, word, and deed."
Then Akela read out very slowly the following questions,
and each Cub answered them in his heart&mdash;not
out loud, but silently, for God only to hear:</p>

<p>"Have I done my best to pray well when saying my
private prayers and at camp prayers?</p>

<p>"Have I really meant to please God to-day?</p>

<p>"Have I done my best in my orderly duties, and in
other things I have had to do?</p>

<p>"Have I given in to other people quickly and cheerfully
when given an order?</p>

<p>"Have I spoken as I should not?</p>

<p>"Have I been disobedient?</p>

<p>"Have I been unkind to another boy&mdash;selfish?
quarrelsome? unfair?</p>

<p>"Have I told a lie?</p>

<p>"Have I done anything else I am sorry for?"</p>

<p>Then, after a pause, Akela said:</p>

<p>"Tell God you are truly sorry, on your honour as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
a Cub, that you have grieved Him by the sins of
to-day."</p>

<p>Then there was perfect silence for a moment, and
after that, the Cubs said, all together:</p>

<p>"May Almighty God have mercy upon us, and
forgive us our sins, and bring us to life everlasting."</p>

<p>Then they said a short psalm, and the following
beautiful little hymn:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Now with the fast departing light,<br />
Maker of all, we ask of Thee,<br />
Of Thy great mercy, through the night<br />
Our guardian and defence to be.<br />
<br />
Far off let idle visions fly,<br />
And dreams that might disturb our sleep;<br />
Naught shall we fear if Thou art nigh,<br />
Our souls and bodies safe to keep.<br />
<br />
Father of mercies, hear our cry;<br />
Hear us, O sole-begotten Son!<br />
Who with the Holy Ghost most high<br />
Reignest while endless ages run. Amen.<br />
</div>

<p>Then came "A prayer that we may be forgiven any
wandering thoughts we have had while reciting these
prayers," and, to end up with, "Our Father" once
again, because it is the prayer that Christ Our Lord
specially told His friends to use.</p>

<p>The nine o'clock gun booms out across the Solent
as the Cubs and Akela, having bidden good-night to
Father and Mother and Godmother, walk down the
hill to the Stable. The sea looks like a great piece of
shimmering grey silk. "Look at the little twinkle
lights!" says a Cub. It is the street lamps over on the
mainland, but they look like so many winking
diamonds. There is quite a cluster of them on the
grey ghost of a battleship, and the old, round fort has a
light which looks like the red end of a cigar. "Please,
<i>please</i> let us go down to the front and look at the little
twinkling lights," beg the Cubs. So, on condition
they get undressed in five minutes, Akela says "Yes."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>A few minutes later the Stable and the Coach-house
are having an undressing race. One of the two tiny
rooms has been made into a little chapel. In less than
two minutes the first Cub ready whisks once round
the yard in his night-shirt, like a white moth in the
dusk, and into the chapel to say his prayers. The door
stands open. In the red light of the tiny lamp you
can see the little white form kneeling on the floor,
very quiet and devout. Presently he is silently joined
by another&mdash;there is only room for two, it is such a
wee chapel. Several impatient people in pyjamas
think it would be fun to start jazzing in the courtyard,
till Akela warns them, "No story if you start ragging."</p>

<p>Soon all prayers are said, and the people in the
Coach-house are in bed, and ready to "invite" the
Stable. The Stable having been duly invited, its eight
occupants come in, and each finds a place on a palliasse.
It is a warm, still night. The great doors of the
Coach-house stand wide open. The stars are out thick
by this time. Little black bats flit and swoop about
in the darkness. If you keep very still you can just
hear the gentle "hshshsh, hshshsh" of the sea. The
candle flickers as the night gives a little sigh. A few
Cubs are rolling about on their straw beds. "Shut up,
all!" commands an imperious Sixer. "Now, miss,
go ahead."</p>

<p>Akela is sitting on a palliasse already occupied by
two people. Silence reigns, for these Cubs belong to
a story-telling Pack, and it is almost the only time
they are ever quite quiet. "Well," begins Akela, "many
hundreds of years ago there lived a boy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>


<h3><br /><span class="smcap">The Story of St. Benedict.</span></h3>

<p>Many hundreds of years ago there lived a boy called
Benedict. He lived in Italy. His father and mother
were rich people, and lived in a beautiful house on a
beautiful estate. St. Benedict and his twin sister must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
have been very happy playing among the olive-trees
and vines of sunny Italy, where the sky is nearly
always blue, and where there are all sorts of lovely
wild-flowers and fruits we don't get in England, and
lizards and butterflies and all sorts of things.</p>

<p>St. Benedict was brought up a good Christian, though
lots of the people round were still pagans in those
days. There were terrible wars and troubles going on
in Italy and in all the countries round, like there have
been in our days. But the boy Benedict in his happy
home knew little of these. Little did he know that
the beautiful fields of Italy were being left to be overgrown
with weeds and over-run with wild beasts;
that the children had never heard of God; that the
poor were dying of starvation. To him the world was
a happy place, where one played and had a good
time, and where people loved Christ and obeyed His
words. But some day he was to learn the truth.
For God was going to use the boy Benedict to do
more than any <i>one</i> man has ever done to <i>civilize</i> the
world. This story I'm telling you is the story of how
St. Benedict discovered all God's great plan for him,
and worked it out, bit by bit.</p>

<p>When St. Benedict had learnt all that his tutors
could teach him at home his father sent him to the
great city of Rome to learn there from the scholars
and learned men, and attend lectures and classes.
St. Benedict was a very clever boy, and he must have
got on very quickly and pleased his masters very much.
He could probably have carried off all sorts of prizes
and won great fame and praise for himself, but there
was something which stopped him caring for things
like that. In the great city of Rome he saw two things&mdash;one
of them was all sorts of wicked, selfish, horrible,
and ungodly pleasures in which men wasted their lives
and altogether forgot God; and the other was the
beautiful, holy lives of the Christians, many of whom
could tell wonderful stories of the martyrs who had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
been killed in Rome not so very long before, and whose
bodies lay in the Catacombs. There were some beautiful
churches in the city, and St. Benedict loved to go
to the solemn services. As he knelt there in the holy
stillness, or listened to the chanting, he began to
<i>think</i>. And more and more he felt that all the glamour
and selfish pleasures and greediness of the people was
stupid and wrong, and that what was really worth
having was a good conscience, and peace, and the
friendship of God. And as he thought, he began to
care less and less for his learning and his chances of
glory, and he began to feel as if he wanted to get right
away from people and have the chance of thinking
about God.</p>

<p>When St. Benedict had these feelings he knew they
came from God, and so, instead of not listening and
just letting himself get keen on his study and his
amusements, he made up his mind that he would
always <i>do his best</i> to follow God's will, and would keep
his heart <i>always listening</i>, so that if God <i>did</i> want to
call him away to some special kind of life he would be
ready to hear and to obey.</p>

<p>Well, when anybody does this God does not fail to
tell him what to do, and so, when St. Benedict had
been seven years in Rome, and was still only a boy,
God made known to him that he must leave Rome,
and his friends and his masters, and go right away into
the mountains. His old nurse, Cyrilla, had always
stayed with him, faithfully; and now she decided to
go with him wherever it was that God was leading
him.</p>

<p>So, one day, St. Benedict and Cyrilla set out secretly,
and made their way by hidden paths towards the
mountains. At last they reached a certain village, and
St. Benedict went into the church to pray God to
make known His will. When he came out the peasants
who lived near the church pressed him to stay with
them. St. Benedict took their kindness as a sign that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
it was God's will, so he and his old nurse settled down
in the village.</p>

<p>It was while the boy was living here that (so
the old books tell us) a miracle happened which made
people feel sure that God was specially pleased with
him. One day, as St. Benedict returned home from
the church where he had been praying, he found his
old nurse very unhappy; in fact, she was crying.
This distressed him very much, because he hated to
see other people miserable. At first he wondered why
Cyrilla was crying, and then he saw the cause. She
had accidentally broken an earthenware bowl that
one of the good villagers had lent her. Full of pity
for his old friend, St. Benedict took up the two pieces
and went outside the house with them, and knelt down.
Then he prayed very hard that the bowl might be
mended. And, as he opened his eyes and looked at it,
sure enough, it was whole! Very pleased, and thinking
how good God is to those who really trust Him,
he ran into the house and gave it to Cyrilla.</p>

<p>St. Benedict had not thought of himself, but only of
God's wonderful power and kindness. But Cyrilla and
the village people to whom she told the miracle all
began to talk a lot about St. Benedict, and say he was
a young saint, since he could do miracles. People even
came in from the places round to stare at him. Do
you think this pleased him? No; he wasn't that sort
of boy. If he had been, God would never have done
anything for him. He was very distressed at the way
people went on; and more and more he felt that God
was calling him away, and had something very important
to say to him. And one day it came to him
that he must leave even his faithful old nurse and
go away. You can imagine how terribly sad he must
have been at that thought, not only because he loved
her and had always had her near him since he could
remember, but because he knew how very, very much
she loved him, and that if he left her she would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
sad and lonely, with no one to comfort her. But you
remember what I told you about how St. Benedict had
made up his mind to do his best always to carry out
God's will, and not give in to himself and pretend he
had not heard; so, because he knew that it is more
important to be faithful to God than to any person
on earth, he made up his mind to go away. He did not
tell his old nurse, but one day he set out, alone.</p>

<p>He must have felt very strongly that it was God's
will, otherwise he would not have dared go out all
alone and unarmed into the mountains, and with no
money or food. Don't you think it was very brave
of him? Perhaps you think it was foolish? Well,
people have often been thought fools for doing God's
will faithfully, but in the end God proves that really
they were quite right. Anyway, something very
soon happened to St. Benedict to show that God was
with him.</p>

<p>As he tramped on, along the mountain-sides, between
the flower-covered banks and thickets full of birds'
songs, he prayed to God to guide him in the right way.
And so when, after some hours of solitary tramping,
he saw a man coming towards him out of a lonely
mountain pass, he felt sure this was someone sent by
God to help him.</p>

<p>The man's clothes showed that he was a monk. As
he drew near he looked curiously at St. Benedict,
wondering who this noble-looking boy could be walking
all alone among the wild mountains. He, himself,
had come out there to meditate and be alone with
God and his thoughts. Stopping St. Benedict, he
asked him kindly who he was and where he was going.
St. Benedict quite simply told him the truth: that he
had come out to seek God's will, and didn't know
where he was going, except that he was seeking some
place where he could live hidden from the whole world.</p>

<p>At first the monk Romanus tried to argue with him
and show him that it was foolish to come out like that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
alone. But St. Benedict spoke so wonderfully about
God's call that Romanus saw he was right, and made
up his mind to help him find somewhere where he
could live alone for a while. So he led him up a steep
winding path, and showed him a cave opening into
the rugged mountain-side. The cave was about seven
feet deep and four feet broad, and there was just room
on the rocky ledge outside to make a little garden.
St. Benedict stepped into the cave with his heart full
of joy, feeling sure that at last he had found the place
he was seeking. Before going away, Romanus gave
him a long garment made of sheep-skin, which was
what the monks of those days used to wear. He also
promised to supply him with food. His monastery
was far up, on the top of the great rock in which the
cave was. He said that every day he would let down
a basket with bread in it for St. Benedict, and he
promised faithfully to keep his secret. Then he went
away.</p>

<p>What happened in the time that followed no one
knows&mdash;it is a secret between God and St. Benedict.
But we can guess that God made known many wonderful
things to His faithful young servant&mdash;things that
later he was to teach to thousands of men; and that
He filled him with grace and strength to do what he
would have to do, to make the world a better place.
Also, we can be sure that he was very, very happy, in
spite of the loneliness, and the dark, cold nights, and
the hard ground he had for his bed.</p>

<p>Three years St. Benedict lived like this, and then
one sunny Easter morning God made known St.
Benedict's secret to a certain holy man who lived in
those parts, and told him to go to the cave and take
St. Benedict some of his Easter fare. St. Benedict
was very pleased to see him, but surprised to hear it
was Easter, for he had lost all count of time. So the
priest laid out the good things he had brought, and
they said grace, and then they had a meal together,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and then a talk. After the priest had gone some
shepherds and country-folk climbed up the steep little
path to see where he had been, and they found St.
Benedict. He welcomed them, and spoke so wonderfully
to them that they saw he was a man specially
taught by God. They felt he was their true friend
and loved them for God's sake, and so they often
climbed the steep path to visit him and ask his help
and advice. But very soon news of him spread
beyond the mountain shepherds, and people of all
sorts from far and near flocked to see the holy man
and ask his prayers and his advice. Sad, wicked
people went away with sorrow for their sins, and
became good. Cowards went away full of strength
and courage. And many people began to learn a new
way of serving God truly, always <i>doing their best</i> for
love of Him, and never "giving in to themselves."</p>

<p>It was then that God allowed St. Benedict to have
a terrible temptation, to test him. Suddenly he felt
within him a great desire to give up all he was doing
for God and return to the wicked city he had left
and live a life of ease and pleasure. It was the Devil
who put this thought into his mind, but God's grace
in St. Benedict was stronger than the Devil. With all
his heart he vowed that he would <i>never</i> give up doing
God's will, and, to punish himself for the thoughts that
had entered his mind, he threw himself into a mass of
sharp, thorny briars and stinging-nettles, so that his
flesh was all torn and stung. After that he was so
strong that no temptation was ever able to conquer
him, and he was able to lead thousands of souls to
victory.</p>

<p>The time had come when God wanted St. Benedict
to leave his cave. He had learnt what God had to
tell him in secret, and now his great work was to begin.</p>

<p>A large number of men who wished to serve God
with all their hearts began to collect round St. Benedict.
Gradually they formed twelve monasteries, all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
within about two miles, and got St. Benedict to rule
over them all. This was the beginning of St. Benedict's
great work for God. He drew up a Rule which showed
men how they could live in the way most pleasing
to God. It was not so terribly hard as to be impossible
for ordinary men, like some of the holy hermits and
Saints in the past had taught. And so thousands and
thousands of men began to promise to keep this Rule
and to live together in monasteries, doing good. St.
Benedict had many wonderful adventures during the
rest of his life, but I must keep those stories to tell
you another time. The end of this one is that after
God had called St. Benedict to Heaven, his great work
went on. His followers began to travel all over the
world as missionaries, teaching the pagans about
Christ, and bringing peace and goodness to the poor,
sad, wicked world. They cultivated the land and
made it fruitful; and built churches and hospitals and
schools; and taught the children, and looked after the
poor, and <i>civilized</i> the world. It was they who brought
the Christian Faith to England, for St. Augustine was
one of St. Benedict's monks, and did more than anybody
else to make England the great country which
she became; for before St. Benedict's monks came the
country was all wild and the Saxons were heathen.
So, you see, by listening for God's voice, and doing
his best to obey faithfully, the boy Benedict became
one of the men who have done very great things
for the world.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"Tell us some more," said the Cubs sleepily.</p>

<p>"Tell us all the adventures St. Benedict had."</p>

<p>"No, no," said Akela; "that was a long story.
Now you must go to sleep and dream about St. Benedict,
and then you will be ready to get up and have
a glorious day to-morrow."</p>

<p>So the Stable boys stumbled sleepily back to their
own quarters, and Akela tucked each of them up in
his blankets.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later everyone was asleep.
As Akela crept softly round she could only hear the
regular breathing of sound sleepers. True, at midnight
Patsy made some loud conversation, and
thought he could do without any blankets at all, but
he did not wake up even then, and was soon tucked
up quietly again.</p>

<p>So ended the First Day.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE SECOND DAY</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> sun has already been up some time when the first
Cub wakes up and wonders where he is. Finding he
is in camp, he feels sure it would be a good turn if he
thumped the sleeping form next him and woke him
up, that he, too, may have the delight of remembering
that "to-morrow" has actually come&mdash;the first real
day in camp! These two make conversation to each
other, and become so cheery that soon everybody else
has woke up. It is 6.30, so Akela gives leave for
everyone to turn out.</div>

<p>There is a tap in the Stable-yard. Soon everyone
is washing in a tin basin. The two cooks have dressed
quickly, said their prayers in the little chapel, and are
off up the hill to the camp field.</p>

<p>At the Stable it is some time before everyone is
thoroughly washed and dressed, beds are tidied, and
everything spick and span. Then the crowd of happy
Cubs race off to the field.</p>

<p>The fire is burning merrily, and a big dixie of porridge
bubbling for all it is worth. Away, between the trees,
you can see the blue sea glinting and sparkling. Overhead
the sea-gulls circle on silver wings, and cry good-morning
to each other as they pass with swoops and
dips, like so many tiny aeroplanes. The dew is thick
on the grass, the blackbirds sing, the sun shines, and
the camp-fire sends a steady column of blue smoke
into the fresh morning air. How different to early
morning in London! With a howl of joy the Cubs
scatter over the field.</p>

<p>Here comes Godmother in a big blue overall and a
sun hat; and Father and Mother appear at the same
moment from the farther corner of the field. They
take over the cooking, and the two cooks run off for
a bit of sport after their labours.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Then everyone collects in the council circle for
prayers. A short run wild again, and then a series of
whistle-blasts calls the Pack in for breakfast. In come
rushing the ravenous Cubs, and each squats down
where the cooks have placed their mugs in a circle.
Caps off, and all stand quiet for a moment, for grace,
and then porridge and mountains of bread-and-butter
begin to disappear at a great rate.</p>

<p>Breakfast finished, the pots and the pans washed up,
the Pack invades the post office, and, armed with
picture postcards and pencils, the Cubs squat along
the sea-wall and write to their mothers. That duty
done, and spades, pails, boats, and shrimping-nets
bought, they lose no more time in getting down on to
the shore.</p>

<p>It is a happy and hungry crowd with wet and
rumpled hair that turns up again at camp, all ready
for the splendid dinner Mother and Father have
cooked.</p>

<p>After dinner a rest, while Godmother reads aloud.</p>

<p>The day ends up with a wonderful shrimping-party.
Besides shrimps, the Cubs catch every kind of funny
little sea-creature&mdash;star-fishes, jelly-fishes, baby sea-anemones,
tiny, tiny crabs, a devil-fish, baby dabs,
and everything else you can think of. The tide is right
out, and there are mysterious green pools under the
pier, full of feathery red sea-weed and little darting
fishes. Of course, Sam falls into one in his clothes, and
comes out looking like a drowned rat. Akela wrings
him out and sends him home to get into dry clothes,
for the sun is beginning to sink.</p>

<p>Supper, night prayers, a race down the hill, a few
minutes, to see the little twinkling lights, and the
happy family is getting undressed in double quick
time, for Akela has promised a good story to-night&mdash;a
"nexiting" one about a robber chief.</p>

<p>Soon everyone in the coach-house is settled on his
palliasse, and has invited a Stable Cub to share it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
with him. The candle has been lighted and stuck
with a dab of grease on the ledge.</p>

<p>"Fire ahead, miss," commands a Sixer. Silence
reigns.</p>

<p>"The story I told you yesterday," said Akela, "was
about a boy who started good, and went on being
good all his life. To-night I am going to tell you
about a boy who started good, but became bad, and
was very wicked until he grew up, when something
happened which sent him on the great adventure of
serving God."</p>


<h3><br /><span class="smcap">The Story of St. Guthlac.</span></h3>

<p>Many hundreds of years ago, in the days when
England was ruled over by the Saxon Kings, there
lived a boy called Guthlac. He was a very intelligent
boy, not dull, like some children; he was obedient to
the grown-ups, and, as the old book says, "blithe in
countenance, pure and clean and innocent in his ways;
and in him was the lustre of Divine brightness so
shining that all men who saw him could perceive the
promise of what should hereafter happen to him."</p>

<p>But when he got to be about fifteen he forgot all the
things he had been taught as a child. When he felt
a kind of restless longing for adventure rising up
inside him, and a desire to do wild things, and a cruel
feeling that he did not care what happened to other
people so long as he had a good time, he <i>gave in to
himself</i> and began the most wild and reckless life you
can imagine. He armed himself with a great ash-bow
and a sharp spear from his father's armoury. He
slung a shield on his back, and stuck his belt full of
knives and daggers and arrows. Then he went about
and collected a gang of all the wildest boys he could
find, and put himself at their head. Then, going
through all the country round, these wild boys attacked
anybody they thought was an enemy of theirs, paid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
off old grudges, killed and wounded innocent people,
set fire to their houses, and did all the damage they
could. Mad with excitement and lust for blood, they
soon became just a robber band, attacking friend and
foe alike, killing just for the pleasure of killing, or
sacking farms and houses to satisfy their greed.
They knew all the woods and by-ways so well that
no one could catch them. After a time they began
to build themselves huts where they could sleep, and
also hide the treasure they had plundered from rich
men. You can't imagine any wicked or horrible
thing they did not do. And, of course, they forgot
God entirely, though once they had been Christian
children and had been brought up to know and love
God. Nine years passed like this, and then something
happened.</p>

<p>One night as Guthlac, the chief, lay on his bed of
rushes and soft, warm skins in the darkness of the
wooden cabin, thinking over the excitements of the
day and planning all the wicked things he would do
the next day, a wonderful thought flashed into his
mind, and it seemed to swallow up all the other
thoughts. He lay still, gazing into the darkness and
trying to understand what it was. Then, gradually,
he found that it was <i>God</i> he was thinking about&mdash;God,
Whom he had forgotten for nine long years.</p>

<p>He did not turn away his mind, but went on thinking
about God until his heart was full of a kind of glow
that was <i>love</i>. He was surprised, for he knew he did
not really love God; for he was spending all his days
fighting against Him by every wicked thing he could
imagine. And then he began to understand that this
feeling inside him was sent by God&mdash;it was God's love
for him, and not his love for God. Could it really
be that God loved him? He was so very wicked
and cruel, and God&mdash;God was so good and just and
merciful.</p>

<p>The robbers, sleeping on their rush beds, breathed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
heavily; they were tired after a hard day. Guthlac
listened to their breathing. They were his men; they
obeyed him as their chief. He remembered the day,
nine years ago, when he had thought of the bold
robbers and sea-kings and brave men of the past, and
longed to show that he was as daring as they, and
could lead men to war. But as he lay, very wide
awake, with the strange feeling of God near, he began
to think of other great men he had heard of in his
childhood&mdash;men just as brave and daring as the sea-kings,
just as good leaders of men, more famous and
wonderful, and&mdash;lovers of God.</p>

<p>God loved them, and they loved God and gave all
their strength and courage to serve Him. They were
His special friends. And now it seemed to Guthlac
that God was filling his heart with love and asking
him to be His special friend. A great feeling of shame
came over him. How could God forgive him and
want him for a friend after all the terrible things he
had done? But suddenly a great longing filled him
to be one of God's special friends, and obey Him, and
go on always loving Him. He longed for Christ to
become his Chief and Leader; and then he began to
understand that this would mean he must tell God
from the bottom of his heart that he was sorry for all
the wicked things he had ever done, and must promise
on his honour that he would never again do a single
one of them.</p>

<p>Guthlac sat up in bed and thought hard. This
would mean that he must give up being a robber, give
up his free life in the woods, give up leading his daring
followers, give up all the unlawful pleasures of which
his life was made up. It would be a terribly big
giving up .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but then, what a big, big thing he
would get in exchange! He would get the friendship
of God, and the knowledge that he had become very
pleasing to Him. Stretching wide his arms in the
darkness, he told God that he gave up <i>all</i>, <i>all</i>, <i>all</i> that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
was wicked, and he begged to be forgiven and made
clean once more, like an innocent little child. Then,
very happy, he lay back on his bed of skins and fell
asleep.</p>

<p>The sun was streaming into the long, low room
when Guthlac awoke. It was a glorious English
spring morning. The sleeping robbers were stirring,
one by one, beneath their warm deer-skins. They
little thought that their chief, sitting up in bed with
the morning sun in his eyes, was thinking about God,
and how wonderful it was that He had come to him
in the night and called him to become one of His
friends. It was rather difficult to believe, in the light
of day, with the coarse laughter and wild voices of the
robbers ringing out on the morning air, and yet Guthlac
knew it was true, and <i>knew that he had made a great
promise</i>. He was too brave a man to go back on a
promise, however hard to keep, so he stood up with
a strong purpose in his heart.</p>

<p>The first step would be to tell his men. That would
be terribly hard. He suddenly felt very lonely, and
wished there was someone else there to back him up.
Then he remembered that the Lord Christ was his
Chief. Surely He would be near and help him in
his first adventure?</p>

<p>So he stepped out into the dewy woods, where all
the birds were singing as if they, too, loved God with
all their hearts. And he called his men about him to
hear the important thing he had to say. They all
came crowding round, expecting to hear some splendid
new adventure that Guthlac, their chief, had planned
for them.</p>

<p>Then he stood up, taller than any of them and more
splendid, and in his clear, ringing voice he told them
that a wonderful thing had happened&mdash;God had called
him to join the band of His brave friends. When God
calls there's no hanging back. And so he had given
up for ever the robber's life. He was no longer their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
chief. He had found a new Chief for himself, and
was off, at once, on the adventure of God's service.
And so he bade them&mdash;good-bye.</p>

<p>The robbers looked at each other in horror and
surprise. What had happened to their chief? Was
he mad? What would happen to them without their
brave leader? Falling down on their knees about
him, they begged him to stay; but Guthlac's eyes
were already looking away at the new adventure he
saw before him. The pleasures of his old life did not
seem worth anything now; he scarcely heard the
voices of his friends as they pleaded with him.</p>

<p>At last they gave up all hope of persuading him, and
Guthlac walked away through the woods, leaving his
old life behind him for ever.</p>

<p>He did not know where to go at first, but he felt
sure Christ, his new Chief, would help him; and, sure
enough, he presently remembered that not very far
away there was an abbey of St. Benedict's monks.
He knew those men were all Christ's friends, and he
was quite sure they would welcome him.</p>

<p>So he walked through the woods until he came to
the abbey. There he knocked loudly on the great
door, and presently a brother opened it. He must
have been terrified when he saw the tall young chieftain
standing before him, for all the countryside feared
Guthlac. But very soon the brother saw the love of
God shining in Guthlac's eyes, and the gentle humility
in his voice showed that he was no longer the cruel
robber, but a servant of Christ.</p>

<p>The monks took Guthlac in and made him welcome.
Soon he found that conquering himself and the Devil
was a harder fight than he had ever fought against his
enemies in the world, but he threw himself into the
battle with all his heart. He did not do things by
halves, but began to serve God with all his might,
because before he had fought so hard against Him.
Remembering how often he had got drunk with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
wine he had stolen, he now would not drink one single
drop even of the wine the monks were allowed to have.
At first the brothers did not like this, but soon they
began to understand the strong resolve of the young
robber, and, seeing how very pure his heart was and
how much he loved God, they all loved him. The
curious old book which tells all about him says: "He
was in figure tall, and pure in body, cheerful in mood,
and in countenance handsome; he was modest in his
discourse, and he was patient and humble, and ever in
his heart was Divine love hot and burning."</p>

<p>For two years he lived in that monastery, and then
he began to long to live a harder life for Christ's sake.
He heard about the hermits of old days who used to
live apart from other men in wild places, and he got
leave from the Abbot to follow their example. So one
day he set out.</p>

<p>He did not choose the beautiful green woods that
he had once roamed in, but turned towards a most
horrible place&mdash;a great marsh full of pools of slimy
black water, and reeds, and rough scrub and bushes.
It was the most lonely place you can imagine, and
people feared to go there because they said it was
haunted by evil spirits.</p>

<p>On an island in this lonely fen St. Guthlac settled
down with two servants. It was a very hard life, and
the Devil sent him all sorts of horrible temptations
and haunted him and gave him no rest; but St. Guthlac
rejoiced in the chance of fighting under his Captain,
Christ, against the evil spirits.</p>

<p>It would take too long now to tell you of all the
wonderful things that happened to St. Guthlac on
this island&mdash;we must keep them for another time.
For God rewarded his love and his courage by giving
him a wonderful gift of miracles and of great wisdom,
so that the news of him gradually spread all over the
country, and people began to understand that the
great robber had now become a great Saint. And so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
from far and near, the people flocked to him. But
one thing more about him I will tell you.</p>

<p>Though he had now no human companions, and
chose to set all his love on God, he had a wonderful
friendship with the wild animals that shared the island
with him. In those days there were many wild beasts
in England, such as wolves. These would come to
St. Guthlac and eat out of his hand. Even the fishes
would come to him; and as to the birds, they did not
fear him at all. The swallows, which are very timid
birds, would come and settle all about on him, and
there were some ravens which were a trouble because
they were so tame and would come and steal things
from his house. Once a holy man called Wilfrith,
who had come to see St. Guthlac, was surprised to
see the swallows settle on him, and (as the old book
says) asked him "wherefore the wild birds of the
waste sat so submissively upon him." St. Guthlac
explained to him in these words: "Hast thou never
learnt, Brother Wilfrith, in Holy Writ, that he who
hath led his life after God's will, the wild beasts and
wild birds have become the more intimate with him?
And the man who would pass his life apart from worldly
men, to him the angels approach nearer."</p>

<p>So it was that the wild place called Croyland became
a place of God, and St. Guthlac, through God's power,
was able to do more good to his fellow-men than ever
he had done them harm in his wild days. But though
St. Guthlac was doing miracles as wonderful as those
of the Old Testament prophets, and preaching in his
wilderness as wonderfully as St. John the Baptist did
in his, God did not mean to leave him there very long,
for He wished to have His brave and true friend in
heaven. After fifteen years St. Guthlac, who was
still almost a young man, fell ill. Knowing that God
was calling him to Heaven, he gladly began to prepare.
His illness lasted only seven days, and he himself
knew that he would die on the eighth. But he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
nothing to fear, for he had so truly repented of his
sins that night when God spoke to him first that they
had been all washed away. So he lay in his little
house waiting. And when one of his faithful servants,
who was some way off, at his prayers, chanced to
look up, he saw the house with a kind of bright cloud
of glory round it. And this brightness stayed there
till day broke. And at dawn St. Guthlac called his
servant and gave him last messages for his friends.
"And after that," says the old book, "he raised his
eyes to heaven and stretched out his arms, and then
sent forth his spirit with joy and bliss to the eternal
happiness of the heavenly kingdom."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"That was a good one," said the Cubs. But they
were too sleepy to ask for another story, as usual, and
in less than five minutes every one was asleep, sailing
away through the dream-sea towards the golden,
sunlit country called "To-morrow."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE THIRD DAY</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>Seven</span> o'clock and no one awake yet! Akela crept
softly out and roused the cooks. Sam woke quickly,
but Bill was just like a hermit crab&mdash;the more you
poked him, the more he drew back into his shell and
hid his head under his blanket. Presently, however,
he began to uncurl, opened his eyes very wide, sat
up, and discovered it was not his mother calling him,
but that he was at camp. He got up quickly, and
was the first ready.</div>

<p>Gradually they all woke up, but no one was in such
a hurry to turn out this morning.</p>

<p>They put on uniform and boots and stockings, for
it was not to be a shore day.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, haversacks were packed with grub,
and the whole party tramped off along the sea-wall to
Ryde. The first thing that happened was a beautiful
service in a very beautiful little church, for on this
day (August 15th) the Pack always goes to church.
Then five of the younger ones who didn't fancy a long
tramp went home with Father and Mother, and the
rest set off on an adventure.</p>

<p>Along the roads and lanes they went, but the way
did not seem long, for they talked of so many interesting
things. After about two miles, as they were
going along a narrow lane, they suddenly came on a
man sitting on the bank, who stood up and said,
"Hullo!" The Cubs gave a yell and fell upon him,
for, you see, he was their Scoutmaster.</p>

<p>He led the way past an old ruin, under a ruined
archway, and along a little path, till they got to a
great building called Quarr Abbey, where he was
staying. There, under the shade of the trees, the
weary travellers sat and had an enormous lunch.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Three big jugs of cider had been provided for them.
It was the first time they had ever tasted cider, and
Akela began to be afraid they would never be able
to walk home straight if they drank any more; so it
was decided to pour the remainder into the water-bottles,
and take it back for the five boys in camp.</p>

<p>After dinner the Scoutmaster took the Cubs for a
row in the creek, and afterwards they bathed. Then
they had a good tea, and were allowed to see over
the abbey and go down in the crypt under the church.
It interested them very much to see a wonderful
library of eighty thousand books! Some were
hundreds and hundreds of years old, and all done in
writing and painting, because there was no printing
in those days. Some were books done in the very
first days of printing. There was one enormous book
you could hardly carry, and by it a tiny wee little
book you could put in your waistcoat-pocket.</p>

<p>At last it was time to go home, and they set out
once more to tramp along the lanes. The evening sun
shone down through the thick green leaves, and the
blackbirds sang as if they were saying all sorts of
important things to each other, if only you could
understand. The grey, broken arches of the ruined
abbey seemed to tell sad tales of long ago&mdash;seemed full
of secrets nobody will ever hear.</p>

<p>"It's been a good adventure," said the Cubs, and
they tramped home contentedly, for their minds were
full of things to think about.</p>

<p>Even at the end of a four-mile tramp they were
ready to run up the grassy hill into the camp, each
keen to be the first one to tell Father and Mother about
the eighty thousand books, and the ruin, and the cider,
and the crypt. The five Cubs enjoyed the cider, and
everyone talked at the same time round the camp-fire
that night, all telling different things.</p>

<p>"Story to-night, miss?" said a Cub, suddenly.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Akela.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good one?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;a very good one about a soldier-Saint."</p>

<p>"Hooray! Buck up, boys, and let's get down to
the Stable for the story," cried the Cub, cramming the
last bit of bread-and-cheese into his mouth.</p>

<p>The trampers were quite ready to lie down on their
beds that night.</p>

<p>"It's been the best day we've had yet," they said;
"and now, please, tell the story."</p>

<p>So Akela curled up on someone's palliasse, and
silence fell.</p>


<h3><br /><span class="smcap">The Story of St. Martin.</span></h3>

<p>A little more than three hundred years after Our
Lord formed the Christian Church and then went back
to Heaven, having promised always to be in spirit
with His people, a boy called Martin was born in
Hungary. This boy God chose to be a very great
leader among His people, the Christians, and so He
began to arrange Martin's life in such a way that he
should be led, little by little, to the fulfilment of God's
plans. Now, part of God's plan was that Martin
should be given the chance of <i>conquering himself</i>,
and, with the addition of a lot of God's grace, be
made strong and able to bear bravely the terrible
dangers and hardships that were bound to go with
a high position in the Church of Christ in those days
of persecution. This story I am going to tell you is
the story of all the hard things and disappointments
and adventures God sent to the boy Martin, in order
to prepare him well, and bring him, at last, to the
position he was to fill in the Church.</p>

<p>Well, the first thing that happened was that the
Holy Spirit put into the little boy's heart the idea of
praying to a wonderful, unknown being, Whom he
called "the God of the Christians." You see, his
father was a pagan, and Martin had never been taught<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
anything about God, and must have picked up this
idea all on his own. He had no church to go to, or
anything, so he set to and built himself a little chapel
on the top of a hill near his home, and there he often
ran off and prayed to the God he knew so little about,
but Who, he felt sure, was a kind and loving friend of
little boys.</p>

<p>Well, God was pleased to see that Martin had
answered so well to the idea He had sent into his
heart, so He rewarded him by making something
happen, which was the next bit of His plan, so to
speak.</p>

<p>Martin's father was a soldier, and had risen from
the ranks to the position of Colonel in the Roman
Army. To repay him for his good services he was
given a farm in Italy. And so, when Martin was ten
years old, his father and mother moved to this farm,
and Martin found himself living in a country where the
Christian Faith was openly practised and people loved
and served "the God of the Christians," Whom Martin
had so much longed to know more about.</p>

<p>You can imagine how pleased the boy was; and
before long he had discovered the house of the priests
who taught young pagans all about the Christian
faith, and had begun to go to them regularly to learn.
His father did not take much notice of this, and thought
his small son would soon forget all about it when he
got old enough to enter the life his father had decided
he should follow&mdash;the exciting life of a soldier.</p>

<p>But Martin was not dreaming of battles and the
adventures of a soldier's life, for he had discovered
that among Christians there was such a thing as
specially giving yourself to God, and bravely breaking
away from all the things you love by nature&mdash;like
riches and fine clothes, and nice food, and friends, and
adventures in the world, so as to love Christ only, and
follow the adventures of the spirit to which He will
lead His loyal soldiers. While still a boy Martin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
decided that this was the life for him, and he began
to long to leave his comfortable home and go and join
the hermits who lived in caves. So you can imagine
that when his father began to talk about his starting
his military training he was very much dismayed.
Being a frank and honest kind of boy, he looked his
father bravely in the face, and told him straight out
that he wanted to be a Christian and give up his
whole life to it.</p>

<p>Martin's father was very angry indeed. He stormed
at the boy, and when he found that was no good, he
thrashed him. But nothing could make Martin change
his mind, and at last he decided the only way was to
run away from home.</p>

<p>But I told you God meant Martin to become a
leader. To have run away and lived with the hermits
would not have given him just the kind of training
he needed, and the chance of showing he could stick
to God through real difficulties. So God let the next
bit of His plan happen.</p>

<p>Martin's father told the Roman officials that his son
had come to the age at which all boys had to undergo
their military training (though he hadn't, really). And
as Martin would not go and "join up," a kind of press-gang
lay in ambush one day and captured him, and
he was led away in chains and forced to take the oath
of military allegiance.</p>

<p>His father being a Colonel, Martin was given a good
position in the army straight off, and had his own
horse and his own servant. Of course, nearly all his
companions were pagans, and the life of the army was
of a pretty low standard. But Martin stuck faithfully
to the kind of life he knew was pleasing to God, and
tried in his dealings with his fellow-men to do things
in the brave, kind, generous, unselfish way Christ
would have done them. Of course, this made all the
soldiers and his fellow-officers love him, and they must
often have wondered why he never got angry, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
cheated, or grumbled and swore at unpleasant things;
and why he was so very kind to his servant, and always
ready to give up his place or any little privilege to other
people. Though no one knew it, even his pay he
gave away to the poor. And yet he was not yet a
baptized Christian, for in those days people used to
wait a long time and prepare themselves very carefully
for the great honour of being made one of the children
of God; and during this time of waiting they were
called catechumens.</p>

<p>It was at this time, while Martin's regiment was
stationed in France, that a very wonderful thing happened
to him&mdash;for God was still planning his life and
giving him chances; and, if he took them, rewarding
him with special graces which should turn him gradually
into a brave "soldier of Jesus Christ."</p>

<p>One cold wintry day, as the wind whistled down the
narrow streets of Amiens, Martin's troop came clattering
through the old gateway, the soldiers wrapping
their great military cloaks close round them, for the
bitter French winter seemed to freeze their Southern
blood. By the gate of the city they noticed, as they
swung by, an old, ragged man. The wind fluttered his
tattered rags about, and he stretched out his thin
hands, all blue with cold, hoping for a few pence to
buy himself some food. The soldiers, however, passed
him by and gave him nothing. But when Martin
reached the corner and saw the piteous sight his heart
was touched, and he reined in his horse. He felt in
his pockets, but, alas! they were empty, for he had
given away all he had to some other poor person. He
was very sad, because he always felt the poor were
a kind of <i>chance</i> given him by God of showing his love
for the Lord Christ, Who had said that if you served
the poor and naked and hungry and unhappy you
really served <i>Him</i>. Well, Martin felt he simply
<i>couldn't</i> pass on and give the old man nothing. And
suddenly the idea came to him that he was warm in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
big cloak, and the old man very cold. What if he
gave his cloak? But it was his uniform, and he knew
that he must not ride out without it altogether, so he
took it off, drew his sword, slashed it in half, and then,
bending down with a smile, put the warm folds about
the old man's cowering shoulders.</p>

<p>Of course, the soldiers and other officers laughed;
but Martin didn't care&mdash;he was willing to be what
St. Paul calls "a fool for Christ's sake."</p>

<p>And now comes the wonderful thing. That night
as Martin lay in bed, asleep, a wonderful vision came
to him. Suddenly his room seemed full of angels, and
in the midst of them was Christ. <i>And</i>&mdash;on His
shoulders was Martin's half-cloak! Then Our Lord
spoke. "Martin," He said, "dost thou know this
mantle?" And then He turned to the angels, and
He said: "Martin, yet a catechumen, hath clothed
Me with this garment."</p>

<p>You can imagine what St. Martin felt! But besides
the joy in him, there was a feeling that Our Lord was
a little disappointed because he was only a catechumen
still, and not yet baptized and made a real part of
His Church, a real child of God. And so, feeling that
God wished him to have the great honour of Baptism,
he went to the priests, and started on the long, hard
preparation that they used to have in those days.
No meat might he have, nor wine, and he must pray
a lot, and often watch in the church the whole night,
and in many other ways practise not giving in to
himself. Only at Easter and Whitsun were the
catechumens baptized; and then they were clothed
in white garments, which they wore for a week. These
were meant to show the perfect purity of their souls,
from which all stain of sin had been washed away by
the waters of Baptism.</p>

<p>At last the great day came, and Martin received the
wonderful Sacrament with great love and humility.
But now he felt that he simply couldn't let his hands<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
be stained with the blood of his fellow-men, and that
the soldier's life was not for him. And so, when the
Emperor came one day and inspected his regiment,
which was shortly to go into battle, he asked him if he
might leave the army. "Until now I have fought for
you," he said; "let me henceforth fight for God.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
am a soldier of Christ, and it is not lawful for me to
take part in a bloody battle." The Emperor was
very angry. "Coward!" he cried. "It is not religion
that causes you to refuse to fight&mdash;you are <i>afraid</i>."</p>

<p>So, to show them he was not afraid, Martin offered
to go into battle in the very front rank, but to go
unarmed (since he would not shed human blood).
And, to show that he trusted in Christ as his protector,
he said he would go without armour or helmet.</p>

<p>His challenge was accepted, and he was put under
arrest, lest he might try to escape.</p>

<p>Of course, he spent the night praying, and the next
day everyone was astonished by some strange news.
The enemy had sent a despatch to sue for peace, and
to say they would agree to the Emperor's terms. So
there was no battle; and not only was Martin's life
saved, but the lives of many other brave men.
Probably the Emperor saw God's hand in the unexpected
action of his powerful enemy, for he at once
gave Martin leave to go free.</p>

<p>At last Martin found himself at liberty to follow the
life he had always felt called to; and once again God
sent him where things should happen to him which
would finally lead to the accomplishment of God's
great plan.</p>

<p>After making a pilgrimage to Rome, which was now
not only the head of the worldwide Empire, but the
kind of headquarters of the Christians, he returned to
France, so as to put himself under the guidance of a
very holy man, called St. Hilary, the Bishop of Poitiers.</p>

<p>St. Hilary soon saw that Martin was no ordinary
young soldier, but was a very promising "soldier of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Jesus Christ," and that his services would be very
valuable. He saw, also, that he had received a special
call from God, so he proposed to ordain him deacon.
But Martin was very humble, and he refused the
honour. In the end he let St. Hilary ordain him
exorcist. But directly after this he was ordered by
God in a dream to go back to his native land and visit
his relations and bring them into the Christian Faith.
St. Hilary was disappointed, but he let him go, making
him promise, however, that he would return to the
Diocese of Poitiers, to which he now belonged.</p>

<p>After many adventures, including falling into the
hands of robbers and escaping in a marvellous way,
which must have been through God's help, Martin
reached his old home, and had the joy of seeing his
mother received into the Church, as well as seven of his
cousins and his two great-uncles.</p>

<p>At this time the Church was being persecuted by a
very strong party called the Arians. They were
heretics, who taught that Our Lord was only a man
and not God, and as the Church turned them out on
account of their false teaching, they did nothing but
fight against her. Of course, Martin, the brave soldier
of Christ, stood up for what he believed, so that one
day he was seized by the Arians, beaten, and banished
from his own country. He began to make his way
back to St. Hilary, but when he reached Milan he
learned that his friend had been banished from Poitiers,
and that an Arian Bishop ruled in his place. So
Martin stayed at Milan; and this, too, was a part of
God's plan, because it was his stay here which started
him on an idea which in the end developed into one of
the most important things in his life.</p>

<p>This idea was to form a kind of little monastery
outside the city, where he and a handful of other
young men lived, and tried to do good and to live in
a way specially pleasing to God, and more perfect than
they could do in the busy rush of the ordinary world.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
But after a while the Arians got strong in Milan, and
drove out Martin and his followers. For a while
Martin and a friend of his lived as hermits on a wild
little island off the coast of Spain. But, hearing that
St. Hilary had been restored to his see, Martin went
to Poitiers so as to fulfil his solemn promise. But once
more St. Hilary was to be disappointed, for this time
Martin begged to be allowed to continue his hermit's
life. St. Hilary gave him leave, and Martin now
withdrew to a forest about eight miles from Poitiers.
Here he built himself a hut, and was soon surrounded
by men who wished to lead the same kind of holy life.
This was the beginning of all the wonderful monasteries
of France, which civilized the whole country in time
and taught it to be Christian.</p>

<p>That Martin's new life was really pleasing to God
was soon shown, for God gave him the gift of doing
miracles, and twice he even raised the dead to life.
You will remember how Our Lord specially promised
that His faithful followers, in the years to come, should
do miracles like He had done, and even greater ones.
Well, St. Martin was one of the men who showed that
Our Lord's promise was fulfilled. All the men to whom
the Church has given the title "Saint" have done
wonderful miracles, that God's name might be glorified
and people see that "with God all things are possible."
St. Martin now lived in very close communion with
God, and his miracles showed that he was not just an
<i>ordinary</i> good man.</p>

<p>Besides training his monks, St. Martin was working
very hard among the heathen Gauls. He would press
forward through the forests and preach in the little
villages, and do miracles, and, after instructing the
people in the true Faith, baptize them all, and leave
a happy Christian village where he had found a
miserable, frightened, heathen one.</p>

<p>St. Martin's tender pity for all suffering things is
shown by this little story. One day, as he walked in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the country, he saw a poor, terrified hare dashing along
with starting eyes, and nearly exhausted, for a party
of huntsmen and their hounds were close upon it.
St. Martin saw that in a few minutes it must be torn
to bits by the hounds, for there was no cover for it.
His tender heart longed to help it to escape, because
it was weak and small and frightened. So he called
out to the hounds to stop! And, strange to say, they
pulled up short in their mad rush, and all stood still
as if frozen to the ground, and the poor little hare
scurried away into safety.</p>

<p>Now, this kind of life was just what suited St.
Martin, and he was very happy. He lived apart with
God, and yet had work to do in training his monks in
the way of perfection and teaching the Faith to the
ignorant pagans. But he had not yet arrived at the
end of God's great plan for him. And if God now
called him away from the life he loved to a life he did
not want at all, we must not be surprised, for Christ
said that those who would be His disciples must <i>deny
themselves</i> and take up their <i>cross</i> and follow Him,
and that is what all good Christians must be ready
to do&mdash;that is, live according to <i>the way God wants</i>
instead of according to the way <i>they want</i> themselves.</p>

<p>Well, the change came when St. Hilary died; for
of course the people wanted St. Martin to become
Bishop in his place. To be Bishop was a very great
honour, and one that many men would have been glad
to accept. But St. Martin was humble, like all Saints;
and he also felt that if he was to remain pure of heart
and close to God he must live in the quiet solitude and
silence of his monastery, so he refused to become
Bishop. But that he should be Bishop was God's will,
and also the people were quite determined to have him.
They got him by making him think there was a poor
sick woman who wanted him to come to her. He
came out of his monastery, all unsuspecting, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
people carried him off by force to Poitiers, and he had
to consent to be consecrated Bishop.</p>

<p>He did not look very like a Bishop as he was brought
into the city. He was clad in a poor, thin old habit,
and his head was closely shaved, as the monks were
accustomed to do, and he was thin and pale with
fasting and his hard life. But even his humble appearance
made the people cheer him all the more; and the
church was absolutely packed at the solemn service
of his consecration as Bishop.</p>

<p>Now began a life in which his own will was altogether
given up to that of God. He lived in a poor little
hut adjoining the church&mdash;the poorness of it pleased
him; but all day he was at it, doing things for people&mdash;now
visiting a sick man to pray over him, now making
peace between quarrelsome people, now blessing oils,
that they might bring healing to the sick; preaching
sermons, talking to people, and explaining Holy
Scripture in the way he could do so wonderfully;
visiting his priests, or listening to the worries and
troubles they came to tell him; and when there was
nothing else, there was always a crowd of people
waiting just to see their beloved Bishop's holy face
and go away cheered with a patient smile from him.</p>

<p>But just sometimes he slipped away for a little
peace alone with God, at a beautiful monastery called
Marmontier, which he formed near the city, and which
later became very famous, and kept the Rule of St.
Benedict I told you about before.</p>

<p>There were many things that were serious worries
and very bitter sorrows and trials to St. Martin at
this time, but I can't tell you all about these now.
But there were also joys; and one of these I will tell
you about, because it was the companionship of a
little boy. He was nearly ten when St. Martin baptized
him and then adopted him. As they travelled
together soon after the boy's Baptism, and while he
still had on the beautiful white robe I told you about,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
which showed outwardly the new purity of his soul,
they came to the River Loire. A little way ahead of
them they saw a poor blind beggar waiting for someone
to help him across.</p>

<p>"Son," said St. Martin to the boy, Victorius, "go
to that man; wash his face and eyes with water from
the river; then bring him to me."</p>

<p>So the boy went and did as St. Martin had told him;
and as soon as he had washed the poor man's eyes, the
man opened them and found he could see! With joy he
looked about at the blue sky and the river; and when
he heard that it was the holy Bishop who had sent the
white-robed boy to him, he praised God for what had
happened, and ran and fell down at St. Martin's feet.
The poor beggar was very excited about it all, and
didn't know how to thank St. Martin and the boy.
So St. Martin said:</p>

<p>"Calm thyself, cease talking, and come; for with
me in this boat thou shalt cross the river."</p>

<p>So the beggar stayed with them three days, and
Victorius was allowed to look after him, and, as the
old book says, "eagerly brought him everything to
eat that he liked best."</p>

<p>Victorius stayed always with St. Martin, and went
about everywhere with him, scarcely ever leaving his
side. Even to the church he would go with him for
the night offices; or on his tours visiting the churches
or preaching to the heathen. St. Martin taught
Victorius, and in return the boy waited on him; also,
I think, he must have cheered up the old Bishop, and
often made him feel a boy again. But don't you think
Victorius was a very lucky boy? He saw a great
many wonderful miracles of the Saint, and was even
allowed to have a hand in the doing of some of them,
as in the case of the blind beggar. When Victorius
was old enough, St. Martin made him a priest, and
<i>himself</i> cut off the young man's hair in the way priests
used to have it cut.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>There are a great many more wonderful stories
about St. Martin which I haven't time to tell you now;
but gradually, gradually he was establishing the
Christian Faith very firmly in France. God's great
plan was being fully worked out, for, you see, St.
Martin had never resisted God's will in any point;
always he had done just what he felt God was gently
leading him to do, never mind what it cost him at the
time. And so he took each step that God arranged
for him, and each one led on to the next, and all led
on to the wonderful life of building up the Church of
Christ, and making it bigger, stronger, purer, more
healthy; and the great work, too, of turning a heathen
land into a powerful Christian country.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 12em;"><a href="#Page_39"><i>See page 39.</i></a></span>
</div>

<p>At last came the day when the tired old Bishop felt,
with unspeakable joy, that he was to go and receive
his reward at the hands of Christ, Whom he had loved
so faithfully and so long, and was to enter into his rest.</p>

<p>One day, after a long journey, St. Martin was thinking
of returning to his beloved Marmontier, when a great
weakness came over him.</p>

<p>"The moment of my deliverance is at hand," he
said.</p>

<p>His monks and other faithful companions were nearly
broken-hearted.</p>

<p>"Oh, Father, will you then leave us?" they cried.
"Ravening wolves will fall on your flock, and who will
protect it when the shepherd is struck? We know
your longing to depart and to be with Christ, but your
reward is assured and will be greater by delay. Have
pity on us who must remain."</p>

<p>So St. Martin prayed a beautiful prayer, because he
loved his children more than himself, and he was even
willing to put off his reward and his longed-for rest
for love of them.</p>

<p>"Lord," he said, "if indeed I still be necessary to
Thy people, I refuse not the labour. Let only Thy
will be done."</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>But it was not Our Lord's will that His faithful
soldier should fight any longer. Christ was waiting
for him, all ready to say, "Well done, good and faithful
servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord."</p>

<p>And so, lying humbly upon a bed of sackcloth, St.
Martin, Apostle of France, finished the work that God
had given him to do, and passed into the glory and
eternal rest of the Blessed.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE FOURTH DAY</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>A gorgeous</span> day of steady, hot sun that made the sea
sparkle like a million diamonds scattered on a great
stretch of blue, blue satin. The tide was very far out,
leaving a golden stretch of sand that simply asked to
be tunnelled into and dug into holes and trenches
and castles. The Cubs all got into their bathing-costumes
(the Cubs' "costumes" were <i>mostly</i> bare
Cub!), and spent the whole morning burrowing like
moles into the sand, and getting cool in the sea when
they felt like it. Akela tried to write something "very
important," but the Cubs didn't seem to think it
nearly as important <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'at'">as</ins> Akela did, and not much
writing got done.</div>

<p>After dinner and rest, when the tide had come up,
like a great green monster swallowing up the shore,
and clutching with foamy fingers at the rocks, Akela
hired a boat and took half the Cubs at a time for a
row, while the other half ran along the shore ready to
scramble in, when their turn came.</p>

<p>The wind had got up, and out to sea there were no
end of "white horses" shaking their manes and
galloping after each other. Do you know what "white
horses" are? They are the white crests of the waves
that break out all over the sea on windy days. Some
of the "white horses" came galloping close in to shore,
and the Cubs had a very exciting time landing to give
the others a turn. This is how they did it. One large
Cub rolled up his shorts as far as they would go, and
stood ready in the bow. Akela then turned the boat
shorewards suddenly, and pulled at the oars for dear
life, and all the Cubs helped by cheering. "Crash&mdash;scrunch,"
the boat went ashore; the Cub in the bow
leapt out, and held her nose steady while everyone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
else scrambled out. A few "white horses" jumped
over the stern and made things a bit wet, but nobody
minded. In scrambled the next boatful of Cubs, and,
with a good shove, the boat was out again.</p>

<p>A very little make-believe and you were lifeboat-men
landing survivors from a wreck.</p>

<p>There was to be a long and <i>very exciting</i> story
to-night, so the Cubs bustled down to the Stable extra
early, and were undressed before you could say "Jack
Robinson." In fact, Terry began to undress in the
street, and was out in the Stable-yard in his night-shirt
before Akela and the last Cub had got through
the gate.</p>

<p>"Tell us a long, long, long one," begged the Cubs;
"we aren't a bit sleepy. Let it last till midnight."</p>

<p>"I'll tell as long as the candle lasts," said Akela,
sticking a stump of candle on the ledge.</p>

<p>The Cubs curled up, and the candle-light fell in a
golden flicker on their ruddy, sunburnt faces. Fifteen
pairs of eyes were fixed on Akela. You couldn't hear
a straw rustle. Only the faint "Swish-sh-sh&mdash;<i>Sha</i>-<i>a</i>-<i>a</i>-<i>ah</i>"
of the "white horses" breaking on the
shore broke the stillness.</p>

<p>"Now we are going back, back, back into a thousand
years ago," began Akela, and the Cubs gave a wriggle
of satisfaction, and prepared to take that mighty
journey with the greatest ease.</p>


<h3><br /><span class="smcap">The Story of St. Edmund, King and Martyr.</span></h3>

<p>Now we are going back, back, back into a thousand
years ago, and more. We shall stay in England, but
it is a strange, wild England, covered with deep,
mysterious green forests, where speckled deer roam
about, and on moonlight nights you can hear the
wolves howling. The Englishmen of these days are
nearly as fierce as the wolves. If you met one coming
down a forest path I believe you'd be a bit afraid of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
him, with his fierce eyes and shaggy head of hair, his
round shield and sharp spear. A good many of these
Englishmen are still heathens. But St. Benedict's
monks have been hard at work for the last few hundred
years turning the wild country into the beautiful
England we know, and the fierce, cruel Saxons into
brave Christian knights, with kindly, noble hearts as
well as fearless spirits.</p>

<p>Well, in a part of the country called East Anglia
there lived an old King called Offa. He was a Christian,
and descended from a line of brave and noble
Kings called the Uffings. Poor old Offa was very sad,
because he felt he was getting old, and he thought that
when he died the royal line of Uffings would end, for
he had no son to succeed him.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact he <i>had</i> got a son, but many years
before God had called this boy to give up all thoughts
of worldly glory and become a holy hermit, giving up
his life to prayer. When God calls a man to serve
Him and Him alone, He does not let the world suffer
by his loss. God had a plan of His own for replacing
Offa's hermit son by one of the most glorious Kings
that ever reigned in England, and it is the wonderful
story of how he was found, and of his thrilling adventures
as the young King of East Anglia, that I'm
going to tell you to-night.</p>

<p>Well, something&mdash;perhaps it was a whisper from the
Holy Spirit&mdash;made old King Offa feel that if he prayed
very hard he might in some wonderful way obtain an
heir to his throne.</p>

<p>In those days, when people wanted to pray very
hard and show God they <i>really</i> wanted a thing, and
really believed He would give it them, they used to do
what was called "going on a pilgrimage." It was like
<i>doing</i> instead of only <i>saying</i> a great prayer, for the
whole, long, dangerous journey was one act of faith
and devotion or of thanksgiving.</p>

<p>So old Offa set out on a pilgrimage to the very best<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
place you could pilgrimage to&mdash;the land where Our
Blessed Lord lived and died, where there are still the
very same rocky paths His Blessed Feet touched, the
same mountains and lakes His Eyes rested on, the very
hill where His Precious Blood poured down from the
Cross, dyeing the grass and the little white daisies red.
Somehow the King felt that if he could go and pray
where Our Lord had prayed he would get some wonderful
answer. So he started off, crossed the blue sea
and landed on the opposite coast. Now, God is so
ready to grant the prayers of people who have so
much love and faith that He sometimes answers almost
before they have asked. That's what happened with
the old King. His way lay through Saxony, the
kingdom of his cousin Acmund. One day he rode up
with his men-at-arms to the Court, and decided to
spend a few days there. Acmund, of course, welcomed
his cousin, and received him joyfully to the palace.</p>

<p>Well, as King Offa sat resting on one of the low
couches covered with the skins of wild beasts that
Acmund had killed in the chase, there was a light
footfall outside the chamber, the heavy curtain was
drawn back from the doorway, and there stood before
him a tall, slim boy of thirteen, with fair hair, truthful
blue eyes, and a face tanned with the sun and wind
of his open-air life. Something seemed to jump up
in the old King's sad heart. Oh, if only that noble
boy were his son, his heir! He was a true Uffing.
What a King he would make for East Anglia!</p>

<p>In the next few days Offa and the King's son,
Edmund, became great friends. Edmund took upon
himself the job of looking after his old cousin, and
seeing that he had all he needed and enjoyed his visit
at the Court. And Offa watched Edmund with a
feeling of love and interest such as he would have had
for his own son. He saw that the boy was brave and
clever, a good shot with his bow, able to throw a spear
straight and ride a horse. He saw that he was loved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
by all, and always ready to do good turns and put
the wishes of others before his own. But he saw
something that pleased him more&mdash;that Edmund was
a true, loyal Christian. In all the excitement of the
chase and the gaiety of the Court, his first thought
was of God&mdash;to serve Him and please Him, to keep
from all sin for His sake.</p>

<p>The more Offa saw of Edmund, the more sure he felt
that God had led him to this Court that he might find
his heir. Still, though it seemed as if his request was
already granted, he did not give up his pilgrimage, but
decided to press on, if only as an act of thanksgiving
to God.</p>

<p>Before starting once more on his way, the King
called Edmund aside. Taking a gold ring from his
finger, he put it on Edmund's hand, and told him that
if it were God's will this might some day mean great
things for him. Then he said good-bye, and rode
away towards the East.</p>

<p>Young Edmund must often have wondered what it
was that God held in store for him, and as he looked
at the gold ring on his finger I feel sure he used to
promise God that whatever it was he would <i>do his best</i>
to fulfil His Holy Will.</p>

<p>Well, old Offa reached Palestine all right. His
heart thrilled with joy and love as he saw the very
village where Jesus was born, and where the shepherds
came that early Christmas morning to adore the little
new-born King. He remembered the three Kings of
the East, who came plodding along on their camels,
bearing gifts for Mary's little Son.</p>

<p>Then he went on to Mount Calvary, and the tears
ran down his old face as he saw the hill where Our
Blessed Lord suffered such agony, with such glorious
courage, for our sakes. He prayed and gave thanks,
and then, with a confident heart, left all the future in
God's Hands and started homewards.</p>

<p>But he had not got very far before he fell ill, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
soon his men saw that he was dying. Calling them
about him, he told them that it was God's will that
young Edmund, Acmund's son, should be their King.
Taking from his finger the signet-ring that had been
placed upon it by the Bishop at his coronation, he
commanded that when he was dead it should be carried
as quickly as possible to the boy. Then, heaving a
last sigh of peace and gratitude, he closed his eyes on
the world, and his faithful soul went to God.</p>


<h3><br /><i>The Coming of St. Edmund.</i></h3>

<p>Now we will go back to England. The people have
heard of the death of their King, and they are not at
all sure that they want a strange young Prince from
Saxony to come and rule over them. They have
collected in a great crowd on the shore, for the galleys
from across the sea have come in sight, bearing down
before the wind.</p>

<p>The ships draw every moment nearer, and the people
wait. As long as most of them can remember they
have been ruled over by King Offa; and for many
generations their Kings have been Uffings&mdash;tall, fair,
blue-eyed men, with noble, fearless hearts. What will
this strange boy be like?</p>

<p>And on the ship young Edmund pushed his way
forward to the prow. He could see the green, tree-covered
cliffs of his new kingdom, and the crowd of
people on the shore. His heart beat fast, and he
fingered the ring old Offa had put on his hand. Oh,
if only these people knew that he came to them ready
to <i>do his best</i> to be to them a good King&mdash;to <i>do his best</i>
for them, for the love of God!</p>

<p>Splash, splash!&mdash;the big anchors go overboard and
the chains rattle as they run out over the bows. Soon
Edmund and his men are in small boats, being rowed
swiftly to the shore. Edmund's boat is the foremost
and he himself stands up on the prow, ready to leap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
ashore. As the men of England look at him they see
that he is no stranger, but one of themselves, a true
Uffing, and then and there a sense of loyalty springs
up in their rough hearts.</p>

<p>The nose of the boat grates on the shore. With a
leap Edmund has cleared the water, and is standing
on the land of which he is to be King. His first act
is to fall on his knees and ask God's blessing on himself
and his people. His short prayer ended, he gets up
and turns to greet his new friends; but to his surprise
they are all falling on their knees, murmuring to one
another, "A miracle, a miracle!" For a spring of
clear water has bubbled up where Edmund's knees
touched the ground&mdash;a sign from Heaven that he is
the true King, a symbol of the power of the Holy
Ghost that will well up like a spring in his heart.</p>


<h3><br /><i>The Crowning of St. Edmund.</i></h3>

<p>After a time of study and preparation under a holy
man, called Bishop Humbert, who became a true
father to the boy and his lifelong friend, the time of
St. Edmund's coronation drew near. It took place
on Christmas Day, and the old books tell us of the
gorgeous procession and the wonderful service. St.
Edmund had to make a solemn promise of loyalty to
God and his people, and after being anointed with
holy oil he was clothed in certain royal garments by
the Bishop, while a thane stepped forward and put
sandals on his feet, a purple cloak was put upon his
shoulders, and in his hand a sceptre of mercy and an
iron rod of justice. After that a naked sword was
presented to him, and a helmet put on his head.
Then, laying aside all these, St. Edmund stepped
forward, and standing before the altar declared
solemnly that by the grace of God he would fulfil all
the duties of a good King. The Bishop placed the
crown upon his head, saying, "Live the King for ever,"
and the people all cried, "Amen, amen, amen."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>After that there was a solemn service of praise and
thanksgiving to God, and the new King received Holy
Communion. You can imagine how happy it made
the holy young King that this should be the very first
act of his reign, and what confidence it gave him that
Christ would stay with him through all the difficult
years to come.</p>


<h3><br /><i>War.</i></h3>

<p>For a long time there was peace in St. Edmund's
kingdom, though the people in other parts of the
country were suffering terribly from their enemies,
the Danes, who came over in wild hordes from the
North in their low, black-sailed boats, and, landing on
the coast, went through the country burning and
plundering and killing.</p>

<p>St. Edmund knew they would sooner or later invade
his kingdom too. So he set to work to prepare for
them. His chief way of doing this was to win the
loyalty of all his subjects, so that if there was war he
knew they would all rally round him. He made wise
laws, and he was so fair to all, and so ready to listen
to the poor and oppressed and help them, that soon
everyone in the kingdom loved the young King and
would do anything for him. They could see that God
was with him, and they could not help feeling that
in serving the humblest of his subjects he felt that it
was Christ Himself that he served.</p>

<p>St. Edmund had, of course, prepared his army and
had thrown up defences to try and keep the enemy
out as long as possible. You can still see one of his
great earthworks running from Newmarket to the
Fen country. For hundreds of years it was called
"Edmund's Dyke." He placed scouts and outposts
all round his borders, and prepared in every way he
could.</p>

<p>At last the day came when the country people came
running into the towns in terror. They had seen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
along the borders huge, fierce men, with flashing eyes
and long red hair and beards. Their leather tunics
were stained dark with blood. Huge round shields
were slung across their backs; they were armed with
spears, bows, clubs, and knives, and they shouted to
one another in a strange language.</p>

<p>St. Edmund's scouts came running in to say that
the Danes were collecting in great crowds on the
frontiers.</p>

<p>Soon they began creeping in at every point, burning
houses and churches, and killing people, especially the
Christians. Though it was an almost hopeless job,
St. Edmund led his brave army forward, and whenever
it was possible he engaged the enemy in battles and
drove them out. The Danes had never before been
so powerfully resisted, and thousands of them were
killed. There's not time now to tell you all of the
thrilling adventures St. Edmund had at this time, and
of his wonderful escapes from the Danes. Anyhow,
the Danes were so much weakened that they asked
for peace, and after spending the winter in a great
camp at Thetford, they sailed away, full of rage and
hatred and desire for revenge.</p>


<h3><br /><i>A Cowardly Plot.</i></h3>

<p>For a time there was peace, and then a sad thing
happened.</p>

<p>One stormy day when the waves dashed and foamed
up the shingly beach, and the sea and sky were a
leaden grey, the fisher-folk who lived down by the shore
saw a small boat, with tattered sails and broken mast,
being driven before the wind. There seemed to be
a man in it, but he was evidently weak and exhausted,
and was doing nothing to help himself. Presently the
boat was thrown up on the shore, and the fishermen
ran down and collected in a little crowd round it.
Looking down at the helpless man, still clinging to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
spar and drenched with foam and sea-water, they soon
saw he was not one of their people. "A Dane, a
Dane!" they murmured with sullen hate. Then one
who had served in St. Edmund's army suddenly gave
a wild exclamation. "By Heaven," he said, "it's
Lothparch!" Lothparch was the leader of the Danish
army who had done such awful harm to East Anglia
only a few years before. "Kill him!" growled one
man. "Throw him back on the mercy of the sea!"
hissed another. But the man who had fought under
St. Edmund would have nothing of the kind. The
King never allowed a helpless man, even a cruel
enemy, to be killed. So Lothparch was carried up to
the royal palace.</p>

<p>To the surprise of the fierce Angles, St. Edmund
not only made the stranger welcome, but showed him
every kindness. "Love your enemies," said Our
Lord, and sure enough St. Edmund seemed truly to
be obeying that command. Everything the King did
seemed right to his loyal subjects; but there was one
man&mdash;Berne, the King's huntsman&mdash;whose jealousy
was so bitter at St. Edmund's showing favour to a
Dane that he waited till he had an opportunity, and
then he murdered Lothparch.</p>

<p>The King was very angry, of course; but he said
that, though Berne deserved to die for the crime, he
would give him a faint chance of escape; he should be
put in an open boat, and pushed out to sea and left
to the mercy of the waves.</p>

<p>After tossing for many days, Berne was washed up
on a strange coast.</p>

<p>During those lonely days of tossing on the waves,
instead of repenting of his crime, Berne's wicked heart
had been full of hatred for the King. So when he
heard that the land he had come to was Lothparch's
own kingdom, and that his two sons, Inguar and
Hubba, were reigning in his place, a horrible idea came
into his mind. Asking to be taken before the Princes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
he made up and told them an awful lie, saying that
when their father, Lothparch, had been washed up,
helpless, on the coast of England, Edmund the King
had caused him to be cruelly put to death.</p>

<p>Of course, this enraged Inguar and Hubba, and they
at once collected a huge and fierce army, and set out
once more for East Anglia.</p>


<h3><br /><i>A Fight to the Death.</i></h3>

<p>Landing in the North, and marching from York
southward, the Danes plundered every city they passed
through. They burned the monastery that had been
built at Croyland (St. Guthlac's isle), and also those
at Peterborough, Ramsey, Soham, and Ely. Meeting
St. Edmund's army, they defeated it completely, killed
the brave General who commanded it, and took
Thetford by storm. Then they sent St. Edmund a
message to say that he must give up half his kingdom
and pay heavy taxes, or they would do the most
terrible "frightfulness" throughout the land.</p>

<p>But St. Edmund and his men decided to make one
great effort to keep their land in liberty and true to
the Christian Faith. At the head of his gallant army,
St. Edmund marched on Inguar's army, and a ghastly
battle began.</p>

<p>Arrows flew thick; swords clashed on shields; great
spears tore men open and left them to bleed to death.
All day the battle raged, but at night the Danes fell
back exhausted, and St. Edmund held the field,
victorious. But as he stood in the moonlight and
looked upon the scene his heart sank.</p>

<p>Before him stretched the great battlefield, its
trampled grass all soaked in blood; and around him,
silent for ever, lay his great army&mdash;an army of dead
men. With a heavy heart he led back his little handful
of tired and wounded soldiers to the camp.</p>

<p>The next day came terrible news. Hubba, with ten
thousand men, had marched up and joined his brother.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>


<h3><br /><i>The Martyr.</i></h3>

<p>It was hopeless to try and resist any more&mdash;the King
knew it, and his people knew it, and they shuddered
to think of their fate. Then a great idea came to the
King.</p>

<p>It was he himself the Danes hated so. If only they
had him in their power, perhaps they would leave his
beloved country in peace! The more he thought of
this, the more certain he felt that, by giving himself
up, he could buy the peace and happiness and safety
of his people. Christ, his Captain, had done this&mdash;He
had not feared to face the most cruel death to
save mankind, and St. Edmund's heart suddenly leapt
with the thought that he would follow Christ and do
the same!</p>

<p>At first his old friend the Bishop, St. Humbert, tried
to hold him back. But after a while he saw that St.
Edmund was quite resolved. He spoke of it with
such courage and joy that the aged Bishop knew the
Holy Spirit must be in his heart leading him to this
glorious sacrifice of himself, this giving of his very life
for his God and his friends, this quest for the martyr's
crown. And so he gave him his blessing and bade him
do as his brave heart prompted him. So, calling
together his people, St. Edmund told them what he
was going to do. You can imagine what they felt&mdash;how
they begged him with tears not to do it. But
nothing would make him change his mind&mdash;he knew
it was God's Will.</p>

<p>Bravely he gave his last order to his men. It was
that all the gates of the fortress should be thrown open,
all the defences left unguarded, nothing done to stop
the Danes entering it. Then he made his way to the
chapel. Unbuckling his faithful sword, he laid it on
the steps of the altar, and knelt down, with no protection
save God's mercy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>The little chapel was very dim, and full of a holy
feeling. All was still. It seemed to the young King
as if he were far, far away from the rest of the world,
from all the horror of bloodshed and crashing battle-axes
that had filled the last few weeks like some
horrible dream. He let his mind just rest on the
thought of God and His love, and a wonderful peace
came over him.</p>

<p>Near him knelt the old Bishop, and his heart was
near to breaking, for he loved St. Edmund very much.
The tears ran down his furrowed cheeks, and fell
silently on the steps of the altar, but he spoke no
word. Silently the moments passed, and then, suddenly,
a sound broke the stillness that sent a cold
shiver through St. Humbert. Wild shouts, coarse
laughter, the clash and clatter of armed men rushing
in wild triumph through the fortress. It was the King
they were seeking. Where was he? They cared for
nothing but to find him and wreak their revenge.</p>

<p>The shouts came nearer .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the tramp of feet .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
the clang and scrape of spears against the wall.
Nearer, nearer, until the chapel door burst open and
a crowd of cruel faces peered in. Then a wild oath
rang through the quiet of the chapel. They had found
the King! Rushing in, they seized him and dragged
him out.</p>


<h3><br /><i>"Faithful unto Death."</i></h3>

<p>In a field beyond the town the Danes tied St. Edmund
to a tree. They were determined to have a full
revenge. With long whips they began to scourge his
naked body. Each lash was like the touch of a red-hot
iron, and left a long, bleeding wound in the bare
flesh. But St. Edmund only rejoiced that, at last, he
could share truly what Christ had suffered from the
Roman soldiers. No cry escaped him, except now
and then the name of Jesus.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, throwing down their whips, the Danes took
up their bows. The arrows fell thickly round St.
Edmund, piercing him in every part, until, as the old
book says, he was as covered with arrows as a porcupine
with quills.</p>

<p>Inguar, the Danish Prince, looked on with a horrible
smile of cruel enjoyment. Hearing the Holy Name
break like a sob from the mouth of the martyr, he
began to taunt him, telling him to give up his faith
in Christ, since it had only brought him to this. But
St. Edmund was "faithful unto death." Soon, soon
he would receive the "crown of life," the welcome of
the King of kings.</p>

<p>Seeing that nothing could make St. Edmund cry
for mercy or give up his faith in God, Inguar drew
his long sword, and, with a hoarse laugh of triumph,
cut the martyr's head from his body.</p>

<p>Free and glorious the soul of King Edmund rose
from his bloodstained body into the sunlight of
heaven.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>St. Edmund had not sacrificed himself in vain. The
Danes, so greatly weakened by the bloody battles they
had fought, gave up the idea of ruling East Anglia,
and sailed away to their country, leaving St. Edmund's
people in peace, and free to practise the Christian
Faith.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE FIFTH DAY (SUNDAY)</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>Everyone</span> dressed quickly and quietly, found his
Prayer-Book somewhere in the far depths of his kit-bag,
and ran down to sit on the sea wall and wait for
Akela and the last Cub or two (the ones whose boots
had got lost, or who were so fussy about parting their
hair, etc., that dressing took rather a long time).</div>

<p>Very reverently they went into church, and very
quietly came out again and up to the field.</p>

<p>Breakfast, a run round the field to let off steam, and
then down to the shore for a bathe.</p>

<p>In the afternoon every Cub got hold of a piece of
paper and a pencil, and sat, lay, knelt, or squatted in
some corner, his tongue well out and his brow furrowed
with thought, to write home.</p>

<p>Some wrote very private letters, all on their own,
and didn't give the show away even to ask how to
spell the hardest words, like "library" (which might
just as well be "lybary," or "librurry," or "lieberry").
Of course, library, in some form or other, came into
all their letters, because they all wanted to tell about
the adventure of going to Quarr Abbey. Some Cubs,
sacrificing the privateness of their letters, decided that
if Akela or Godmother did the writing, while they did
the <i>saying what</i>, it would be much quicker, and much
more could be told to "mother and all at home." So
they brought their paper and pencils, and asked Akela
to do it in "proper, quick writing." They told <i>everything</i>&mdash;even
what they had had for dinner each day,
and one said his bed at camp was much "comfortabler"
than his bed at home.</p>

<p>After tea there was a little cricket practice and some
tree-climbing, and then supper and, of course, night
prayers. And then, feeling as if they had lived in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
camp all their lives, instead of only five days, the
Cubs walked contentedly down the hill to bed.</p>

<p>Patsy, as usual, was having a free ride on Akela's
back, and he was certainly quite a lot heavier than the
first day.</p>

<p>Before long everyone was established in the Coach-house
and the candle lighted.</p>

<p>"To-night," said Akela, "I'm going to tell you
about a very Cubby Saint. I know he would have
loved Cubs, because he loved small boys and wild
animals; in fact, a certain wolf was a great friend of
his; and he thought it worth while, once, to preach
a beautiful sermon to a flock of birds. He was always
laughing or singing or doing something Cubby, and
he had ideas he used to teach his followers, very much
like our Cub Law and Motto. His name was St.
Francis of Assisi. Now listen, for I specially want
you to make friends with St. Francis, because I love
him very much."</p>


<h3><br /><span class="smcap">The Story of St. Francis&mdash;I.</span></h3>

<p>There was once a boy called Francis, who lived in
a curious old town in the mountains of Italy. The
town was called Assisi. It was all funny little up-and-down
streets and flights of long, crooked stone steps;
and there was a wall all round (to keep enemies out),
and big gates in the wall that were closed at night.
The purple hills and mountains spread away as far as
you could see beneath a blue, blue sky, and all round
the city there were vineyards, and lovely little rocky
paths winding about among the silvery olive-trees.</p>

<p>Francis was the son of a rich merchant called Peter
Bernardone. He was a regular Cubby boy&mdash;always
laughing and singing, ready for mischief, but still more
ready to do anyone a good turn. He was Peter
Bernardone's only son, and he had a jolly good time
of it, because his father had made up his mind that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
young Francis should make a success of life, and end
by being a great man in the town. He used to smile
to himself and rub his hands together as he saw what
a clever, handsome boy Francis was growing up into,
and how everybody loved him, and how he was always
the ringleader in all the fun. As Francis grew to be
a young man his father would encourage him to give
lots of feasts to his friends, not minding how much
they cost, and it pleased him to see that it was always
Francis who was the life of these feasts, making jokes,
leading cheerful singsongs, enjoying himself no end,
and making everyone else enjoy themselves. But
while Peter Bernardone chuckled to see young Francis
so gay and popular, Francis' mother, Pica, used to
notice little things that made her happy too, only
in a different way. She noticed that Francis never
really gave in to himself, like his wild friends; never
overate himself in a greedy way or drank enough wine
to make him drunk; never thought it funny to tell
nasty stories or swear; and if ever God's name was
mentioned, it seemed to make him serious for a
moment. "One day," she said, "he will become a
son of God." But her friends thought it a silly remark
to make, for Francis seemed to be living just to please
himself and have a jolly time. But mothers are
generally right in what they prophesy about their
sons, and Pica's remark was really a very true one.
This story is all about how Francis gave up being a
rich merchant's son and became a poor man who found
all his joy and his riches in calling <i>God</i> his <i>Father</i>.
The change did not come easily, and a great many
wonderful adventures befell him, which I am going to
tell you now.</p>

<p>It all began with a war between Assisi and another
city. Of course, Francis and his pals joined in the
fray and thought it great sport, till they got captured
and carried off prisoners. It was not sport at all
being shut up in stuffy old houses with only a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
food and nothing to do. Francis used to cheer them
up with troubadour songs and stories. But although
he always seemed so cheerful, it was doing great harm
to his health, and when, after a year, the prisoners
were freed and returned to Assisi, Francis became
very ill indeed. So ill was he that he came near dying,
and this experience of nearly passing out into the next
life made him begin to think seriously. When he was
well enough to go out, walking slowly with a stick
because of his weakness, he felt that life could never
be quite the same; he must <i>do</i> something, take a man's
place in the world.</p>

<p>Well, the chance soon came, for all the young
Christian men were called out to fight in a Crusade. A
certain nobleman of Assisi started getting up a party,
and Francis decided to join him. He soon had all his
kit&mdash;armour, a bright sword, a good horse, and all
complete; and with a gay heart, full of a thirst for
adventure and a determination to do great things, he
waited impatiently for the start. He had been rather
puzzled as to what to do with himself, and now he felt
he had hit on the right plan. So it was a bit of a
surprise when, his very first night away, something
happened which unsettled his mind altogether and
made him feel it was not God's will that he should go
to the Crusades.</p>

<p>The night before the party set out Francis had had
a very curious dream, about a beautiful palace, all
hung round with knightly arms, which a mysterious
voice told him was for him and his followers. This
made him so happy that the next day, when someone
asked him what good fortune he had had, he replied
that now he knew for certain he was to be a great
prince and leader of men. But the next night, as he
lay in the hostelry on the first halt along the road,
something still more strange happened. He was not
asleep, and yet, through the still darkness, he heard
the mysterious voice of his dream, and it said: "Francis,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
whom is it better to serve, the lord or the servant?"
"Surely it is better to serve the lord," replied Francis,
softly, into the dark. And the voice answered: "Why,
then, dost thou make a lord of the servant?" Then it
all seemed to flash on Francis, and he felt sure this was
a Voice from heaven, and he replied very humbly:
"Lord, what dost Thou wish me to do?" And the
Voice said: "Return to the land of thy birth, and there
it will be told thee what thou shalt do; for it may
behove thee to give another meaning to thy dream."
He felt so positive that the Voice was from heaven,
that he felt he simply could not disobey it. So,
although it cost him a lot to do it, he turned his horse's
head northwards and rode home.</p>

<p>There was nothing to do now but wait for God to
show him His Will. He tried to settle down again to
his old life of feasting and gaiety, but somehow he
couldn't throw himself into it. There was something
he was feeling after, but he didn't know what.</p>

<p>One day something happened which was the beginning
of great things.</p>

<p>Francis had been out for a ride beyond the city.
As he turned his horse's head homewards and rode
slowly back towards the golden sunset, he suddenly
saw, a little way ahead, something that made him
shudder and almost turn aside on to another path. It
was a poor leper, his filthy rags only half covering his
wretched body, with its horrible running sores. His
face was swollen and disfigured, and his eyes full of
the frightened misery of a hunted animal. Now, seeing
lepers always made Francis feel quite sick. He hated
horrible sights. But somehow, to-night, a new feeling
woke up in him&mdash;a sudden feeling of brotherhood with
this poor man, almost of love for him. It was such
terribly bad luck that he had caught leprosy and become
a ghastly sight, so that he could not earn any money
nor come near the town. Francis felt in his wallet for
a silver piece to give him, and then he thought how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
sad it must be to have money flung at you by strangers,
who passed by with head turned away because they
loathed the very sight of you. How the lepers must
long for just a friendly look, a smile! A great idea
suddenly leapt up in Francis's mind, and it took all his
courage not to give in to himself. As he came up with
the leper, he jumped off his horse, took a silver piece from
his pocket, and held it out to the man. The leper, full
of surprise, held out his poor swollen stump of a hand,
with several fingers already rotted away, to take the
coin. But meeting the man's eyes, and seeing in them
the look of hunger for friendship, Francis took the poor
hand in his, as he would the hand of his friend, pressed
the coin into it, and then, stooping, pressed his lips
upon it in a kiss. Then, with his heart full of joy, he
remounted his horse and rode home.</p>

<p>With that kiss a wonderful new idea had sprung up
in Francis's heart&mdash;a sense of love for the poor, of
longing not only to help them, but to share their very
lives, to be one of them. At first he tried to satisfy his
longing to help them by making great feasts and serving
his poor guests with his own hands. One day he went
on a pilgrimage to Rome, and as he saw the crowd of
beggars clustering round a certain shrine in hope that
the pilgrims would give them money, he longed to
become just one of them. So, taking one of them aside,
he exchanged his fine clothes with the beggar for his
dirty rags, and spent the whole day with his poor
brothers in the dust and the scorching sun, enjoying
the sense of being a mere outcast to whom rich men
threw ha'pence.</p>

<p>Still, when he returned to his home he was as puzzled
as ever as to what he should do. He took to spending
long hours at prayer in a certain cave begging God to
make known His Will; and at last God answered his
prayer, and I will tell you how.</p>

<p>Francis had been for a long walk outside the city,
and as he returned along the stony little mountain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
paths, the evening sunlight dazzling his eyes, and the
olive-trees whispering to each other in the soft evening
air, he noticed a tumble-down little wayside church.
Something made him stop and turn in.</p>

<p>It was very dim and cool and quiet. There was no
one there&mdash;except God. A lamp burned with a feeble
flicker in the sanctuary. Francis knelt down and
began to pray. Then, out of the stillness a strange,
wonderful Voice spoke his name&mdash;"<i>Francis</i>." He
knew directly Whose Voice it was&mdash;Our Blessed Lord's.
"Yes, Lord," he answered, his heart beating rather
fast, though he felt very happy. "Francis, go and
repair My church, which thou seest falling," said the
Voice. Then all was still.</p>

<p>The tones of that Voice seemed to vibrate through
and through Francis. He was filled with a great
desire to obey&mdash;to do anything, anything Our Lord
wanted. "Repair My church," He had said. He must
mean this poor little tumble-down house of His, that
was certainly on the point of falling. So Francis
jumped up from his knees and went out into the sunlight
very happy. He found the old priest, who lived in a
poor little house near by, and, telling him the wonderful
thing that had happened, gave him all the money
he had, and promised to return soon with enough to
rebuild the church. Then he hurried home.</p>

<p>His father was away on a journey. So Francis
went down to the warehouse and picked out the most
costly bale of rich stuff he could find. Then he took
a good horse, and, putting the bale of stuff on his
back, set out for the town of Foligno. Here he sold
both the stuff and the horse, and returned with a good
sum of money. Full of joy, he hurried along the little
mountain path to the old priest's house, and held out
the heavy purse of gold to him. But the priest was
afraid to accept it, for he was not at all sure that
Francis's father would be pleased about it. Francis
was disappointed. He had got the money for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
church, and certainly wasn't going to carry it home
again; so he threw it into the deep recess of one of the
windows of the little church, and left it there. Then
he told the priest he meant to stay, for here Our Lord
had spoken to him, and he must stay and see to the
building of the church.</p>

<p>The old priest was very kind, and let Francis share
his little house and his poor fare, and Francis began to
feel like a kind of hermit, living a life of prayer.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Peter Bernardone returned from his
journey. When he heard what Francis had done, and
his new, mad idea of living like a hermit on the mountain-side,
he was furiously angry. Taking a stick in
his hand, he set out, saying he would teach the young
fool a good lesson and bring him home. But one of
the servants ran ahead by a short cut and warned
Francis. Francis had no wish to meet his angry
father armed with a stout stick, so he fled and hid
himself in a cave, and Peter Bernardone had to go
home again, even angrier than he set out. For about
ten days Francis stayed in hiding, the servant bringing
him food. He spent this time in prayer. This made
him braver, and he began to think that he had been
a "funk" to run away and hide and not face the music,
so he decided to make up for it by being braver.</p>

<p>His time of hiding in the dark, dirty cave, with little
food, had made him look thin, untidy, and a bit of a
scarecrow. The people of Assisi had heard what he
had done, and they decided he must have gone mad.
So when he appeared in the city the boys began throwing
stones and rubbish at him, and calling after him.
Francis bore it all patiently, and felt rather a hero.
But presently Peter Bernardone discovered that his
son was being insulted in the streets. It filled him with
rage, and he rushed out, dragged Francis indoors, gave
him a good flogging and shut him up in a little cell.
Here he had to stay for some time, until his father
went on another journey and his mother let him out.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Of course, he went straight back to the little church
on the hill-side, and here, when his father came back,
he found him. Peter Bernardone stormed at him and
demanded the money back, but Francis would not
give it, saying he had given it to God. So Peter
Bernardone went to the Bishop about it. The matter
came up at the Bishop's Court, and the Bishop had to
tell Francis to give back the money. Bernardone was
so angry with his son that he then and there disinherited
him, and said he would not own him as his
son any more. So Francis took off his very clothes
and gave them back to his father, saying, "Now will
I say no more Peter Bernardone is my father, but only
'Our Father Who art in heaven.'" So, taking the
bundle of clothes, old Bernardone stalked out of the
Court.</p>

<p>Someone fetched Francis a rough habit, such as
was worn by the farm-hands. On this Francis chalked
a big cross, and, putting it on, stepped out joyfully,
feeling that at last he was free to serve God, in whatever
way He wanted him to, and share the life of the
poor.</p>

<p>He felt somehow that he must get right away, alone;
so he started walking up over the mountains, not caring
where he went. Soon he was right up among the pines,
and as night fell he found it was pretty cold, for the
winter's snow still lay in the deep shade of the trees.
But he was so happy that he did not care for anything,
and as he went he sang aloud for joy.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, out of the dark wood a band of
robbers pounced on him. "Who are you?" they
cried. "I am the herald of the great King!"
answered Francis. So they stripped him of his habit,
and threw him in a ditch full of snow.</p>

<p>Luckily, the next day he found a friend in a town
the other side of the mountains, who gave him a
pilgrim's cloak, a pair of shoes, and a staff. Then, after
a bit more wandering, St. Francis returned to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
little church and settled down with the old priest,
meaning now in good earnest to build up the church.</p>

<p>Since he had no money to buy what was needed, the
only thing was to beg. So he went out in the streets
begging for stones to build up the little church. The
poor people were very kind, and gave him stones, and
some of them came and helped, and soon they and
Francis together had begun rebuilding the walls.
Every day Francis went begging, and sometimes
it was very hard not to <i>give in to himself</i> and go
skulking down a side-street when he saw a group of his
old friends ahead. But he went bravely on, and
faced their stares and laughter.</p>

<p>One day it struck Francis that he ought not to be
eating the old priest's scanty store of food, which he
noticed his kind old friend used to cook and try and
prepare as nicely as possible for him. This was not
what a true lover of poverty should do. "Rise up,
thou lazy one," he said to himself, "and go begging
from door to door the leavings of the table." So,
taking a big dish, he went round the houses of the
townspeople asking for scraps. They gave him broken
bits of messy old food, and he returned with his dish
full. But when he sat down to supper he didn't feel
at all like eating from that pile of scraps&mdash;the very
thought made him feel quite sick. But he was learning
to conquer himself, and by the time the meal was
done he felt he had really accomplished something,
and was at last really a poor man and ready to live on
what God's mercy would give him from day to day.</p>

<p>All this time he had been praying a great deal, and
learning to know God very much better. More and
more he felt that God meant to use him for something
special&mdash;<i>what</i> he did not know.</p>

<p>At last the little grey church was all built up new
and strong, and Francis felt the job Our Lord had given
him was done. But as God had not shown him anything
else to do, he set out and found another tumble-down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
little church to build up, and started on that.
When that, too, was finished, he started on a third
one. The third one had been restored, and a service
was being held in it for the first time since its restoration,
and Francis was assisting at this service, when
something happened which sent him on a new adventure,
and which proved to be the beginning of the
great adventure which filled all the rest of his life.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"That's a good stop," said Akela. "If we started
on St. Francis's next adventure, we could not finish it
before you all fell asleep. So we will keep it for to-morrow
night. To-morrow you will hear how the boy
Francis turns into the man St. Francis, and what a
wonderful life of service and suffering for God he
begins to have, and how he ends in becoming a great
Saint, and one of the greatest leaders of men."</p>

<h2>THE SIXTH DAY</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>The</span> splashing sound of Cubs making good use of soap
and water; snatches of cheerful song; the lamentation
of someone who had lost the "relation" of his left
sand-shoe; the sound of a Sixer trying to make a sleepy-head
turn out&mdash;all these sounds filled the sunny
morning. Presently there fell on the ears of Akela
(who was still in her "den") the sound of an argument.</div>

<p>"I say it's <i>dirt</i>," cried one; "he's a dirty-neck, who
doesn't know how to wash himself.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>"'Taint!" squealed a small Cub; "it's the sun what's
made my neck <i>brown</i>."</p>

<p>"Garn! it's not using soap what's made your neck
that colour, dirty little.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p><i>Splosh!</i> Somebody got a wet flannel in the eye
that time.</p>

<p>"Now, then, what's up?" cries a Sixer, coming up
to the group. Quite a little crowd collects.</p>

<p>"He says my neck's <i>dirty</i>," wails the small Cub, "and
really it's the sun.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>Someone has a bright idea: "Let's ask Miss."</p>

<p>So Akela comes out, and scrubs the neck in question
with soap and flannel. It turns out to be nearly all
sunburn, with just a <i>little</i> dirt.</p>

<p>The sun is shining, and the sky is full of "flocks of
sheep"&mdash;those tiny, steady white clouds that stretch
in close rows across the sky in fine weather. The dew
on the grass is nearly dry already when the Cubs get
to the field.</p>

<p>"Prayers!" calls Akela, and the Cubs come up
quietly and form a kneeling circle.</p>

<p>I haven't told you what the morning prayers of the
Cubs were, so I will tell you now.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>Breakfast over, and orderly jobs finished, the Pack
went down to the shore and had a splendid bathe.
Several of the Cubs had really begun to swim; while
Bill, Dick, and Mac, who could swim already, were
getting good practice. Mac meant to get his Swimmer's
Badge as soon as he got back to London, so he practised
floating and duck's diving and the other things
you have to do.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>After dinner and rest Father took some cricket practice,
because to-morrow there was to be a match.</p>

<p>"No one must talk to me," said Akela, settling down
in a sunny corner with some papers; "I'm doing something
very important." Cubs always want to know
everything, so of course they said, <i>What was the important
thing?</i></p>

<p>"Reading proof," said Akela.</p>

<p>"What's 'proof'?" said the Cubs.</p>

<p>"This is proof," said Akela, holding out a long
narrow strip of printed paper. "It's the way they
print stories at first, and it has mistakes in it. I have
to read it through and correct the mistakes. Now,
if you don't shut up and go away, the next instalment
in the <i>Wolf Cub</i> will have mistakes in it&mdash;see?"</p>

<p>"Is it the next bit of the 'Mysterious Tramp'?"
cried the Cubs.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>That did it. A Cub sat down each side of Akela
and read over her shoulder, and one jumped up and
down in front, saying: "Miss, is it good?"</p>

<p>Every now and then Akela made strange little
squiggles in the margin&mdash;secret signs only the printer-man
could understand.</p>

<p>"<i>Coo!</i> what silly mistakes he makes!" said one of
the Cubs in derision. "I wouldn't have done that in
dictation even when I was in Standard I.!"</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> think he makes very few mistakes," said Akela;
"other printer-men make lots more. You see, this
one is printing the <i>Wolf Cub</i>, so he has to <i>do his best</i>."</p>

<p>The cricket people had been "doing <i>their</i> best" at
cricket to such good purpose that they had succeeded
in splitting one of the bats.</p>

<p>So after tea Akela and some of them went down to
the man who sells bats and golf-balls, down by the
tennis-courts. The road where his shop is runs
between the seashore and a big stretch of grassy land,
called the Dover.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>"That," said Akela, "is the very place where Billy
got carried up by the giant kite."</p>

<p>It was a favourite story of the Cubs, so they were
pleased to see the place.</p>

<p>"Is that the fierce bull?" said one.</p>

<p>"No," said Akela, "that's a sleepy old cow."</p>

<p>The man said he would mend the bat in time for
to-morrow's match.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><span class="smcap">The Story of St. Francis</span>.&mdash;II.</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>The</span> little church St. Francis had last restored was
very wee, but it had a very long name. It was called
the Portiuncola, which meant "the little portion."
It was built all among the trees and long grass, and
mossy, fern-covered rocks; and the birds sang around
it. St. Francis loved the spot very much&mdash;it was like
home to him&mdash;and he spent a lot of time there. Besides,
it was not far from the leper settlement, and he had
now taken on himself the rather horrible job of serving
the poor lepers&mdash;a job that was very pleasing to Our
Lord, specially as He saw St. Francis did it all for love
of Him, and served each wretched man as if he was
Jesus Christ. Then, too, the Portiuncola was not very
far from the town where Francis begged his food.</div>

<p>Well, early one morning, while the sun shone outside
on the dewy world, and the birds sang their morning
hymns of praise, a priest said Mass in the little chapel,
and St. Francis knelt praying with all his heart. Presently
the priest read out the Gospel, and, as usual, St.
Francis listened with great attention. And suddenly,
as he listened, he felt that those words of Our Lord
which the priest was reading out were a message from
heaven for <i>him</i>&mdash;<i>the very "orders" he had been waiting
for</i>! These were the words:</p>

<p>"Going forth, preach, saying: The kingdom of
heaven is at hand.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Possess not gold, nor silver,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
nor money in your houses, nor scrip for your journey,
nor two coats, nor shoes, nor a staff; for the workman
is worthy of his meat. And into whatsoever city or
town you shall enter, inquire who in it is worthy, and
there abide till you go hence. And when you come
into a house, salute it, saying: Peace be to this house.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Behold I send you as sheep in the midst of
wolves. Be ye therefore wise as serpents, but simple
as doves.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But when they shall deliver you up,
take no thought how or what to speak: for it shall be
given you in that hour what to speak" (Matt. x. 7-19).</p>

<p>Here were clear orders. Something in St. Francis
answered to that call, and this something was the Holy
Spirit of God speaking in his heart, as He always does
in those who really wait and listen and <i>mean</i> to obey
should God speak.</p>

<p>When the Mass was finished, St. Francis got the
priest to read the words over to him again. And then,
feeling quite sure he had discovered God's Holy Will,
he began to obey it <i>at once</i>. He took off his shoes; he
laid aside his second garment, making himself a rough
brown habit; he put down his staff, and he exchanged
his belt for a bit of rope. Then, feeling full of joy, he
set out along the stony road on his bare feet, towards
the town&mdash;not to beg this time, but to give the greeting
of "Peace," and to tell the people to make up their
quarrels and forgive each other, and turn with all their
hearts to the Lord Christ.</p>

<p>The people of the town did not laugh now, and jeer;
they saw that St. Francis was speaking to them from
the bottom of his pure heart&mdash;a heart on fire with the
love of God&mdash;and that the grace of Jesus Christ, his
Master, was upon him. And before long two men of
Assisi had joined him as the first of the great company
who were to follow him&mdash;for you remember how he
was to be a leader, and that the palace of his dream
had been promised to him and his followers.</p>

<p>This is the story of St. Francis's first recruit. His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
name was Bernard de Quintavalle, and he was a rich
merchant, serious and God-fearing, and not a bit like
the gay, eager St. Francis. But seeing how unselfish
and hard-working a life St. Francis led, and that
God's Holy Spirit was with him, he began to visit the
young preacher, and to receive him in his house. St.
Francis willingly gave his friendship to such a good man.</p>

<p>Bernard used to like St. Francis to sleep on a bed
in his own room. Often at night he would lie awake,
thinking; and he would notice that after a short sleep
St. Francis got out of bed and knelt down, and spent
the rest of the night praying to God. The only words
Bernard could hear were just "My God and my All,
my God and my All," which St. Francis repeated over
and over again, as if his soul was really seeing God,
and his heart was so full of love for Him that he could
say nothing else. And Bernard understood the secret
of St. Francis's holiness and purity, for to one who
prays like that God pours out very much grace, so that
he can begin to be all that he knows he ought to be
if he is really to please the Lord Christ, his Master.</p>

<p>So one day Bernard told St. Francis that he wanted
to give back to God all his riches and become his poor
brother. So St. Francis said what they ought to do
would be to go to the church and read in the Gospel,
where the words of Jesus Christ would show them what
to do.</p>

<p>Before going to the church, however, they called for
another friend of theirs&mdash;a learned man called Peter
Cathanii, who also wanted to serve God perfectly, and
had been trying humbly to learn how from St. Francis.</p>

<p>But St. Francis, though holy, and Bernard, though
rich, and Peter, though clever at his books, did not
any of them know their way about in the big Bible
that was kept open in the church for all to read (for
there were no printed books in those days, and a
Bible was very costly, so that few people had a copy
of their own).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>So St. Francis prayed that he might come on the
right place, and then he opened the book. This was
what he read out: "If thou wouldst be perfect, go,
sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt
have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me"
(Matt. xix. 21).</p>

<p>That seemed just right! But perhaps Our Lord
had still another message. So he shut the big book,
and opened it again, just anywhere, and it said:
"Take nothing for your journey, neither staff, nor
scrip, nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats"
(Luke ix. 3).</p>

<p>Splendid! "Just <i>one</i> more, please, Lord," he said
in his heart, as he opened the book for the third time.
And Our Lord told him something very wonderful
and hard to follow, which was really the explanation
of all the others:</p>

<p>"If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself,
and take up his cross, and follow Me" (Matt. xvi. 24).</p>

<p>So the three friends left the church very happy.
And Bernard sold all his rich stuffs and his house and
his land; and Peter sold all his precious books; and
they carried all the gold to a square in front of the
old church of St. George, and St. Francis sat on the
steps with his lap full of money, and gave away great
glittering handfuls to all the poor people who crowded
round.</p>

<p>When none was left, the three poor brothers, smiling
with delight at being really poor and true followers
of Christ, went off to the dear little chapel in the woods
and began the life of the Friars.</p>

<p>Not long after, a third recruit turned up, and I <i>must</i>
tell you about him. He was a simple working-man
called Giles. When he heard about St. Francis and
his two Friars, and of this new way of learning to
serve God perfectly, he laid down his tools, and left
the vineyards and tramped into the town. He went
to an early Mass at St. George's Church, hoping to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
find St. Francis there, as it was St. George's Day; but
not doing so, he set out for the Portiuncola. He didn't
know where that was, so when he came to the crossroads
he stopped and began to ask God somehow to
show him the way. And just then St. Francis came
out of the wood. Giles was delighted that God
answered his prayer so quickly, and, kneeling down
at St. Francis's feet, "Brother Francis," he said, "I
want to be with you for the love of God."</p>

<p>St. Francis saw at once that this was a true brother,
so he said: "Knowest thou how great a favour the
Lord has given thee? If, my brother, the Emperor
came to Assisi and wished to choose one of the citizens
to be his knight or chamberlain, many are they who
would come forward to claim the honour. How much
more highly, then, shouldest thou esteem it to be
chosen by the Lord from out of so many, and to be
called to His Court!"</p>

<p>Then St. Francis took him back and showed him to
Bernard and Peter, and said: "See what a good
brother the Lord hath sent us!"</p>

<p>Soon after this the four Friars set out, St. Francis
and Brother Giles going together, and Bernard and
Peter, to tramp the roads from place to place, and
preach to the little knots of country or town people
who collected round them in the market-places. So
strange did they look, and so full of joy and love did
they seem to be, that the people wondered at them
very much, and though some believed them to be
servants of God, others thought them mad.</p>

<p>When they returned to the Portiuncola three more
men joined them. It was then that the townspeople
began to get angry, and say that St. Francis was
turning rich men into <i>beggars</i>. Even the Bishop spoke
seriously to him. Now, if St. Francis had not been so
<i>sure</i> that what he was doing was <i>God's plan</i>, and not
his own, he might have got discouraged and given up
trying to carry it out; but, relying on God's grace, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
listened humbly while people spoke angrily, or scoffed,
or argued, or pleaded, and then he bravely "carried on."</p>

<p>For the first few months the brothers lived in their
little hut at the Portiuncola, and prepared themselves
(by prayer and the studying of the perfect way of life
and the correction of their faults) for the great work
God held for them. Part of the day was spent serving
the lepers and doing simple work in the fields. One
more journey they went, and then, four more brethren
having joined them, and St. Francis having had a
wonderful vision which showed him that hundreds
would soon be flocking to join his Order from France
and Germany and England and all the countries, he
set out for Rome, to get the Pope's approval of his
work. At first the Pope would not listen to this poor,
unknown beggar-man, full of eager new ideas, but in
the end he received him kindly and, after hearing all
he had to tell, said: "My son, go and pray to Jesus
Christ that He may show us His will; and when we
know His will more certainly, we shall the more safely
sanction your pious purpose."</p>

<p>So the brethren all prayed hard.</p>

<p>When St. Francis went again, the Pope was even
more kind, for he recognized St. Francis as the man he
had seen in a dream. In his dream he saw a church
nearly falling and being held up by a small man in a
poor habit, and he knew it meant the Church of Christ
was in trouble, and that this man was going to make
it strong again through all the earth.</p>

<p>So the Pope gave the Friars his blessing, saying:
"Go forth in the Lord, brothers." And he gave them
leave to preach penance, and told them to come back
to him later and he would do even more for them.</p>

<p>So the Friars went back to Assisi full of joy. For
a time they lived in a kind of wayside shelter called
Rivo Torto; but later on the monks on whose land
was the Portiuncola gave the little chapel and the bit
of land to St. Francis (or rather rented it to him, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
payment being one basket of fish per year, caught in
the river&mdash;for St. Francis did not wish the Friars to
<i>own</i> anything).</p>

<p>Some more men joined the brothers, and now they
lived as a very happy family in their little huts, built
of branches, around their beloved chapel. St. Francis
was like the loving Father of this family, always kind,
patient, cheery, ready to comfort the sad or nurse the
sick, or explain things to those who felt worried and
did not understand how to get rid of their faults and
serve Christ in perfect purity of heart. You Cubs
would have loved St. Francis, for he was just like a
boy himself. I wish I had time to tell you all the
lovely little stories about him and the Friars at this
time while his family was still small, but we must keep
them for another time, and go on now to the time
when the Order had grown so large that the Friars
could no longer all live at the Portiuncola, and began
to have their poor, simple houses all over the place,
while hundreds of brothers set forth, tramping the
world over, preaching the Gospel of Christ, not only
to the poor, but to the heathen in barbarous countries.
Some of the brothers were cruelly martyred, and all
had to suffer a lot of hardships, for often people would
drive them away, so that they had to go hungry and
cold, with nowhere to lay their heads for the night.</p>

<p>We cannot follow all the brothers and hear all their
adventures, so I will just tell you one or two which
show what kind of men St. Francis and his Friars were.
Here is one which shows you their obedience and
humility. I daresay it will make you laugh!</p>

<p>The Friars had by now become quite noted for their
preaching, and would often go up into the pulpits of
the churches, where large crowds gathered to hear
them, the Bishop even inviting St. Francis to preach
in the cathedral. Now, among the brethren there was
one called Ruffino, who was very shy and nervous and
felt he simply <i>couldn't</i> preach and face a great crowd<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
of people, all staring at him and waiting for his words.
Now, St. Francis hated that any of his Friars should
<i>give in to themselves</i> about <i>anything</i>. He also loved
them to <i>obey quickly</i>, and do everything they were told
at once, without a murmur. So one day he told
Brother Ruffino to go to a big church in the city and
preach. But Brother Ruffino, instead of obeying at
once, begged St. Francis not to command him this, as he
had not the gift of preaching. St. Francis was not
pleased at this, and he said that, as Brother Ruffino
had not obeyed quickly, he must now take off his habit
and go to the city and preach, clad only in his breeches,
and otherwise naked! So Brother Ruffino stripped,
and went off humble and obedient. But, of course,
when he went into the church and up into the pulpit
dressed like that the men and children of Assisi began
to laugh and say the Friars had gone mad. Meanwhile
St. Francis presently began to be sorry he had
sent off poor Brother Ruffino clad only in breeches,
especially considering he had once been one of the
noblest men in Assisi. He began to call himself names
for having been so hard on him; and, saying he would
do himself what he had told his poor brother to do,
he stripped himself of his habit and also set out, half
naked, for the town! When he got to the church, of
course everyone laughed all the more to see <i>another</i>
Friar in his breeches. Poor Brother Ruffino was in
the pulpit struggling bravely to preach in simple words.
Then St. Francis mounted the pulpit, and, standing
by Brother Ruffino, preached a most wonderful sermon,
so that all the people of Assisi were touched to the
heart, and many wept to think of their sins and of the
Passion of Christ. Then St. Francis gave Brother
Ruffino his habit and put on his own (for Brother Leo
had brought them to the church), and they returned
home rejoicing.</p>

<p>Once when St. Francis was walking along the road
he saw a great crowd of birds in a field, and saying he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
<i>must</i> go and preach to his "little sisters, the birds,"
he went among them and preached a wonderful sermon
to them, telling them how they ought to praise God
for all he had given them. And the birds didn't fly
away, but all crowded round to listen. At the end
St. Francis gave them his blessing and told them to
fly away, and they rose up in the air and flew away in
the form of a great cross, to north, south, east, and
west. St. Francis loved all animals, even earthworms,
which he would pick up tenderly from the
path and put into safety. And he would never allow
people to cut trees quite down, but made them leave
the roots, so that they might grow up all green and
beautiful once more. Little children he loved, too.
Some day I will tell you the story of a little boy who
joined his Order and became a little Friar, and had
the great joy of seeing St. Francis at prayer one night
out on the mountain-side, with a wonderful gold light
all round him, and heavenly visions comforting him.
But the little boy had to promise St. Francis he
would never tell anyone what he had seen as long
as St. Francis was living.</p>

<p>I must leave, too, the story of how St. Francis tamed
a huge, fierce wolf; and of how he went right into the
Saracen camp during a Crusade and preached to the
Sultan of Turkey, and told him to be a Christian; and
how he called a great gathering of the Friars at the
Portiuncola, to which <i>five thousand brothers</i> came, and
how the people of the cities round came with carts full
of food and fed the Friars for more than a week's time,
freely. All these stories and many more I must leave,
and go on now to tell you of the wonderful, beautiful,
and holy end of St. Francis's life, and of the mysterious
thing that happened to him. I want you to
remember that this mysterious thing is <i>perfectly true</i>,
and really did happen to St. Francis, and is a sign of
how very closely his soul had become united to Jesus
Christ and His Passion on the Cross&mdash;for he had never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
forgotten the heavenly message he had found in the
book of the Gospels: "He that will come after Me, let
him deny himself, <i>and take up his cross</i>, and follow Me."</p>

<p>St. Francis's Order was now established, and his
Friars were renewing the life of the Church by their
wonderful preaching, their holy example, and their
pure lives. St. Francis himself, though not really old
at all, was almost worn out. His life of hardships; his
great worries (for his enormous family gave him much
trouble as well as joy); his burning zeal and passionate
love of God and his fellow-men&mdash;all this had nearly
used up his strength, and now he was in constant pain,
and very nearly blind. He was always patient and
happy&mdash;even merry, as of old. But at last came a
day when he felt he must go away and be alone a little
with God. So, taking a few chosen brothers with him,
he retired to the top of a beautiful mountain, called
Mount Alverna, which belonged to a nobleman who
was a friend of St. Francis.</p>

<p>On this mountain, with only the sky and the rocks
and the trees for company, with the lovely peaks of
other mountains stretching away as far as eye could
see, the six Friars made themselves a little camp of
huts; but St. Francis had his hut right away from the
other Friars, and across a little rocky ravine which
was crossed by a plank. Here he could feel <i>quite alone</i>
with God. Looking up, there was just the blue, blue
sky and the steady clouds; and looking down, there
was a steep rock falling away below him to a great
depth, with little ferns and flowers clinging to it. In
this rocky solitude lived a falcon who became a very
dear friend of St. Francis, and for whom he had a
great love. It knew the time he liked to rise and pray
in the night, and it would come and flap against his
hut and wake him at the right time, and then stay
near him while he prayed.</p>

<p>The Friars were not allowed to come near the spot;
only Brother Leo came with a little bread and water<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
each day, and to join at midnight with St. Francis in
the Divine Office.</p>

<p>At times St. Francis was very happy, and the joy
that fills the Blessed in heaven seemed to glow in his
heart, so that he understood the secrets of God; and
wonderful visions he had too. But sometimes he was
filled with sorrow and pain and temptation, for the
Devil would torment him and try in every way he
could to separate the heart of St. Francis from God.</p>

<p>One day, after he had had a very wonderful vision,
he went with Brother Leo to the little chapel the
Friars had made, and, casting himself on the ground
before the Altar, he prayed to God to make known to
him the mystery which He would teach him&mdash;for he
felt there was some mysterious reason why God had
made him come up this mountain and dwell apart.
Then he told Leo to open the book of the Gospels three
times, and see what it said. And each place Leo
opened on was about Christ's Passion.</p>

<p>Then St. Francis felt quite sure that it was God's
will that somehow he should share his Lord's pain,
and reach the kingdom of God through suffering. And
he longed very much for this, and also to have in his
heart the love which made Christ so willing to suffer
for men.</p>

<p>It was a few days after this that the strange and
wonderful thing happened. St. Francis was kneeling,
absorbed in prayer, when suddenly a wonderful Form
came towards him, and stood on a stone a little above
him. Bright and shining was the Form, with the most
beautiful, beautiful face; and His arms were stretched
out upon a cross, and feet joined together. And He
had two great wings with which He flew, and two
stretched up above His head, and two covered His
body. And as St. Francis gazed upon this crucified
Seraph with the beautiful face full of pain, a great
throb of intense agony shot through his soul and his
body, so that he had never felt such pain or sorrow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
before. And then the Seraph spoke to him as to a
friend and revealed many mysteries. When He had
gone St. Francis rose from his knees and wondered
what it could mean; and then he saw what it meant.
For in his own hands and feet had come the marks of
the crucified Christ: his hands and his feet were pierced
right through with red wounds, and in the palms of
the hands and on the instep of his feet were the round
black heads of the nails, and their points came out the
other side, bent back. And in his side was a big wound,
as if made by a spear. And the pain of them all was
very great. And St. Francis understood that he had
been allowed by God to share in Our Lord's Passion.</p>

<p>At first he said nothing to the Friars; but after a
while he told them, but he did not show them the
wounds, but kept his hands hidden in his big sleeves.
Only to Leo did he show them, so that he might wash
and bandage them because of the pain and the bleeding.</p>

<p>Then, leaving the Friars on the holy mountain, St.
Francis went down with Leo; but he rode on a donkey,
because of the nails in his feet.</p>

<p>He scarcely noticed the places he passed through
or the people he saw, though he did several wonderful
miracles. And at last he came home to his beloved
Portiuncola.</p>

<p>St. Francis's body was almost worn out, and greatly
weakened, too, by the bleeding from his wounds, but
his soul seemed full of new life and joy and energy. So,
riding upon a donkey, he set out for a last journey
through the country he had loved so much, and along
the familiar roads he had so often tramped. I cannot
now tell you of all that happened on this journey and
of the miracles that St. Francis performed; but it was
a wonderful last journey, and already the people had
begun to speak of him as "the Saint."</p>

<p>But towards the end of his journey St. Francis
became so ill that he had to be carried in a litter; and
so it was that at last he came back to the little Portiuncola<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
chapel to die. As you can imagine, he was not
only brave in the face of death, but gay and cheerful.
Many Friars had gathered round their beloved
Father, and he spoke comforting words to them and
blessed them; but he gave a very special blessing to
Bernard, who had been the first man to come and
join him in those early days when he was still alone.
And he made the brothers sing, joyful and loud, the
song he had himself made up on his last journey, called
"The Canticle of Brother Sun"&mdash;a beautiful song all
about Brother Sun and Sister Moon, and the stars, and
flowers, and birds, and grass, and Brother Wind, and
how they must all praise God Who made them. And
when he knew he must very soon die, he cried, "Welcome,
Sister Death!" And he made them lay him on
the ground, without even his habit, and spread sackcloth
over him and sprinkle ashes upon him, and read
to him the story of Our Blessed Lord's Passion and
Death from the Gospel of St. John.</p>

<p>All was still, and outside in the twilight the larks
had gathered, and were soaring up into the evening
sky, singing with all their hearts, as if rejoicing that
in a few minutes the soul of their brother Francis
would be free to soar up with them, and away beyond
even the reach of their swift wings, to the beautiful
garden of God.</p>

<p>And in the house all was of a sudden marvellously
still. And the brothers, bending down over the form
on the floor, saw, through their tears, that their friend
and father had gone. Only for themselves they wept,
for they knew that St. Francis, beautiful and young
and strong and gay once more, was already with his
Friend and Master, the Lord Christ, Who with smile
and outstretched hand would welcome him to his
glorious reward. And the Divine Hand outstretched,
and the hand of St. Francis, would bear the same
print of nails, and St. Francis would understand the
great and wonderful thing that God had granted him.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE SEVENTH DAY</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>When</span> Akela woke up she could hear the roar of the
sea dashing up on the rocks. There was a regular gale
blowing, and every now and then the wind brought a
lash of rain out of the grey sky. So she decided to
let the Cubs sleep as late as possible.</div>

<p>It was 8.30 before the first one woke up.</p>

<p>Arriving at the field, they found that Father and
Mother and the two orderlies had succeeded in getting
the fire to burn (though the rain was coming down
pretty fast now), and hot porridge and tea were all
ready. Prayers and breakfast both had to be in the
store tent&mdash;a bit of a squash, but everyone was as
cheery as usual.</p>

<p>After breakfast it cleared up&mdash;luckily, for a party of
choirboys from Portsmouth were coming over for the
day.</p>

<p>They arrived about 1.0, and were quite ready for
dinner, after the tossing they had had on the boat.
Dinner consisted of large beef and ham sandwiches,
and "spuds," and jam roly-poly. There was a real
hurricane blowing; the beef and ham and bread got
blown off the plates as the orderlies handed it round!</p>

<p>When everyone had eaten as much as they could
hold, the Cubs collected in the lee of the tent for their
rest, and the choirboys, not being Cubs, thought it a
suitable moment to go in the swings and hammocks.</p>

<p>After that there was a cricket match, and then the
Cubs and some of the choirboys bathed.</p>

<p>A big London scout, who had met the Cubs in the
street and claimed brotherhood, also spent the day
in camp. No one knew his name, and he was just
called "Kangaroo," because that was his patrol.
When the choirboys had gone, Kangaroo and the
Cubs had a good rag.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>That night in the Coach-house the big doors had to
be shut, or the candle would never have kept alight.
You could hear the wind whipping up the white horses
all over the great black sea, and laughing to see the
way they jumped up over the rocks.</p>

<p>But it was nice and cosy in the Coach-house. The
Cubs had got out some extra blankets, and sat wrapped
up in them like so many Indian chiefs.</p>

<p>"You promised to tell us St. Antony to-night,"
said Sam.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Akela; "I know you will like the story
of his life. Well, he was one of St. Francis's Friars&mdash;the
most famous one of all. But when you have heard
his story you will see that with the Saints it was possible
for a man to be a "wonder-worker," as St. Antony was
called, and yet think nothing of himself at all, and
expect no one else to pay him honour and respect. So
much did St. Antony hate swank and love humility
that he let no one know what wonderful powers he had,
until one day God made an adventure happen which
showed everybody what he really was."</p>

<p>"Tell us&mdash;tell us," said the Cubs.</p>

<p>So Akela squatted down in the middle of the listening
Cubs, and began.</p>


<h3><br /><span class="smcap">The Story of St. Antony.</span></h3>

<p>To understand the story of St. Antony you must
picture yourselves in the beautiful, sunny land of
Portugal. Oranges and purple grapes and all kinds
of lovely fruits ripen in the old gardens. Galleys full
of rich merchandise come sailing across the blue, blue
sea and touch at the port of Lisbon. All along the
banks of the River Tagus are the big houses of the
nobility. It is in one of these houses that there lives
a boy called Fernando.</p>

<p>Fernando is one of those boys who will always have
a good time. He is very clever and quick, handsome,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
and full of life. He gets on wonderfully well at school,
and he has a fine time in the holidays, for his people
lead a gay life&mdash;feasts, sports, the chase, grand parties
of every sort. Fernando has the chance of seeing a
good deal of life, for he is the kind of boy the grown-ups
are always ready to take out. He gets a lot of
admiration, and he enjoys everything to the full.</p>

<p>But, do you know, when he is alone there is a certain
idea that often comes to him, and he sits on his window-sill
and gazes away across the purple hills, and thinks
and thinks and thinks. The idea is this: that, after
all, this pleasure and gaiety is not worth much; it's
all rather selfish and greedy and stupid. There must
be something more worth while in life. For one thing,
there's <i>God</i>. How little we know of God! And yet
there is a lot to be learnt and understood about Him if
only there was time and quiet and books, and not all
this bustle of parties and grand people. Surely God
wants men to get to know Him, and not be so busy
pleasing themselves that they quite forget all about
Him. Then, again, how rotten it would be to die and
feel you had <i>done</i> nothing in life but please yourself!
After all, there's no end of things to be done to make
the world a better, holier, wiser place. Fancy going
out of the world knowing you were leaving it no better
than when you came&mdash;or perhaps a little worse. Surely
a man must feel rather nervous about dying, and
about the Judgment Day, when he knows he hasn't
ever done anything useful or kind. Why should God
give such men the reward of heaven? <i>Rewards</i> are
for people who have <i>worked hard</i>; and so is <i>rest</i>. And
then, again, when God came to earth and lived among
men, He didn't just spend His time seeking for pleasures;
in fact, He seemed never to think of Himself
at all, but always of other people. That thought
held the boy Fernando more than all the others&mdash;the
thought of Christ, Who could have made Himself a King
if He had liked, spending His days for others, preaching<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
and doing miracles, and the whole long night out under
the stars, under the whispering olive-trees talking to God.</p>

<p>These thoughts used to come to Fernando when he
was quite a little chap, and he had a kind of idea that
when he was a man he would give himself to God. But
when he began to grow up a bit, and got about thirteen
or fourteen, he found that if he didn't look out he
would get so keen on the life of pleasure that he would
become like the gay young men about him, and quite
forget all about God. He began to see that if he meant
to stick to his good ideas he must <i>do something</i> about
it before it was too late. So, after a very hard struggle,
he promised God the whole of himself, with all his
love and all the keen, strong desire within him to do
great things. He knew it would mean giving up all
the pleasures that filled his life, and all the riches and
glory that would some day be his. But somehow
nothing mattered so long as he obeyed this sense that
God was calling.</p>

<p>Of course, his people told him he was a young fool,
and did all they could to stop him; but he stuck to
his idea, and at the age of fifteen he was admitted to
a monastery of Canons, just outside the city, and
exchanged his rich clothes for the white habit.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful monastery, full of holy men and
hundreds of wonderful books, and in the quiet and
peace young Fernando was very happy. He felt he
had really got near to God. He worked so hard at
his studies that by the time he had become a young
man he was admired by all the Canons, who thought
him very clever and gifted, and told each other that
some day he would be a famous scholar and do great
things. Fernando himself felt that God had given
him the gift of preaching; and that if he went out and
preached he would be able to attract great crowds to
listen, and win souls for God; so he worked and worked
to learn all he could, so as to be ready to stand up
and defend the Christian Faith against heretics.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Fernando had gone to another great monastery at
Coimbra, and had been there eight years, when something
happened which was the beginning of a great
change in his life&mdash;the beginning of a great adventure.</p>

<p>One day five dusty wayfarers tramped into the town
and stopped at the little house of the Franciscans, not
far from the monastery of the White Canons. The
five strangers were really five heroes, for they were five
of St. Francis's Friars, bound on a quest so thrilling
and so dangerous that they felt quite sure they would
never come back. They were going to Morocco, in
Africa, to preach to the heathen, and with shining eyes
they spoke of dying there, for the love of Christ, and
winning the martyr's crown! Full of joy they went
on their way; but without knowing it they had set
on fire the heart of the young Canon, Fernando. In
the quiet of his peaceful monastery he could think of
nothing but Africa, the heathen, the chance of sharing
Christ's suffering, and dying for His sake. It was
really the Holy Spirit Who was stirring up those
thoughts in Fernando's heart.</p>

<p>Well, some months later news came that the five
brave Friars had been put to a most horrible death by
the Saracens. They were first scourged till the whiplashes
had almost cut their bodies to pieces. Boiling
oil and vinegar was then poured over them, and they
were rolled on the ground, over fragments of broken
glass and pottery. They were then promised their
lives if they would give up Christ; but as, of course,
they wouldn't, they were beheaded. These were the
first martyrs of St. Francis's Order.</p>

<p>Can you imagine what Fernando felt when one day
a solemn procession stopped outside the church of his
own monastery, and the coffins containing the bodies
of the martyrs were laid within it for a while on their
way to Spain?</p>

<p>Fernando now felt more sure than ever that God
was calling him to be a poor Friar, and to set out barefoot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
for some hot, dusty land away beyond the seas,
where cruel hands would torture him to death. Once
again he offered himself to God, but this time it took
an even harder struggle than it had before, for he
loved his quiet life of prayer and study in the beautiful
monastery even more than he had loved the gay life
of his boyhood. Still, he did not <i>give in to himself</i>.</p>

<p>Next time the poor Friars came, in their old, patched
habits, to beg at the rich monastery, can you imagine
their surprise when one of the most learned and famous
young Canons came out to them, in his stately white
habit, his beautiful face lighted up with a great resolve,
and asked them if they would give him a brown habit,
and make him a Friar, and send him to the Saracen
country to win a martyr's crown?</p>

<p>Of course, they were delighted, and promised to
bring him a habit the very next day.</p>

<p>Fernando had a hard job to persuade the Canons
to let him go. But at last they did; and once more
he turned his back on a happy home and set out on
an unknown adventure. As he left the monastery,
one of the Canons, a great friend of his, called after
him: "Go&mdash;go! You will doubtless become a Saint!"
And Fernando called back to him: "When you hear
that I am a Saint give glory to God!" for he knew
very well that it is only God Who can make a man
into a Saint, and that the man's own efforts can never
do it.</p>

<p>It must have been a great change for Fernando to
find himself in the poor little huts belonging to the
Friars, and obliged to go barefoot, dressed in a rough
habit and cord, with only scraps of food to eat, begged
from the houses of the rich. These Friars were only
poor, ignorant men&mdash;very holy, but with no learning
or refinement. They did not know Fernando was a
very clever man, a scholar. Of course, he did not tell
them, but humbly took his place as the newest and
least important of the brothers, never letting them see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
that he missed the wonderful library, or the beautiful
music of the monastery, or the quiet cell where he had
been able to pray and work in peace. So as to start
life quite fresh, he even gave up his noble name,
Fernando, and took the name of "Antony." So now
we will begin to call him St. Antony.</p>

</div>



<p>Of course, the one thing he kept thinking about was
the quest of the martyr's crown, and at last he got his
Superiors to send him, with one companion, to the
Saracen country. But now came the greatest disappointment
of his life, for no sooner had he got there
than he fell ill. All the winter he lay between life and
death, with a terrible fever, so ill that he could do
nothing. He knew that he was now so weak that he
would never be able to go and preach to the Saracens
and be martyred. He would have to go home again,
a failure. This was much harder to him than any
danger or suffering, and the way he bore it, cheerfully
and patiently for the love of Christ, made him much
more pleasing to God than anything else. For God
loves humble people, who are willing to do His Will,
instead of choosing for themselves.</p>

<p>Seeing that God wanted his life rather than his
death, St. Antony decided to go back to his own
country and become as strong and well as possible.
So he set sail. But when God sees that a man has
altogether given up his own will, He takes full control
of his journey through life, and makes things happen
to show the man what to do. In this case God made
St. Antony's ship get driven ashore on the island of
Sicily. Here there happened to be a small house
belonging to the Franciscans. It was while St. Antony
was resting there that he heard that there was going
to be a great chapter (or general meeting) of the Friars,
at Assisi, and that St. Francis would be there; so he
asked leave to go, and then set forth. This was to be
the beginning of a new adventure.</p>

<p>When he got to Assisi he found two thousand Friars<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
collected there for the chapter. The country people
were providing all their food free.</p>

<p>You can imagine what St. Antony felt when he saw
St. Francis! But when St. Francis called for volunteers
to go on a dangerous mission to the fierce Germans,
it must have cost him an awful lot to keep quiet.
But he had learnt his lesson&mdash;God did not want of
him a glorious death, only a patient life.</p>

<p>When the chapter came to an end all the Friars
dispersed, some going gladly off on their dangerous
quests, others collecting in little bands under their
"ministers," as the head ones were called, and starting
to tramp back to their friaries.</p>

<p>But St. Antony stood all alone. He had no brave
quest to follow; no minister looked for him to go
home with a party of cheerful Friars; no one cared
what became of the young Portuguese stranger.</p>

<p>So St. Antony asked one of the ministers to take
him and "form him in the practice of religious discipline."
The minister little knew the wonderful gifts
of this pale young stranger, with the beautiful, sad
face, and sent him to a humble friary on the top of a
steep, rocky mountain. There were only a few simple
Friars there. One of them had hewed out a little cave
in the rock. This he gave to St. Antony, who made
it his cell. There he spent most of his day in prayer.
But one job he specially made his own. What do you
think it was? Why, washing up the plates and
greasy dishes.</p>

<p>He didn't tell the Friars anything about himself,
and of course they never guessed that their new
brother, who always chose the meanest jobs, was a
nobleman's son and a famous scholar of one of the
greatest monasteries in Portugal.</p>

<p>For a whole year St. Antony lived like this. Do
you think he wished himself back in the beautiful
monastery in Portugal, with his books and his
clever, interesting friends? No; for he loved what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
was God's Will for him above all things. People
should not pine for the past, nor be impatient for the
future; they should live heart and soul in the present,
because the present is always what has just been
provided by God, and so it is the best possible thing.</p>

<p>But God meant His faithful servant to be made
known, and I will tell you, now, the wonderful way in
which He made it happen.</p>

<p>In the town, not far from St. Antony's little friary,
there was one day a meeting of Franciscan and
Dominican Friars for an important ceremony. After
the service the Superior asked the Dominicans, who
were clever men and good preachers, to preach a
sermon. But they all said they were not prepared;
and so did the Franciscans. So the Superior turned
to St. Antony, who had come as a companion of his
Minister, and ordered him to preach. St. Antony tried
to get out of it, but, finding he must obey, he walked
slowly up into the pulpit.</p>

<p>The Friars did not expect much of a sermon. This
was only poor Brother Antony, whose chief job was
washing dishes.</p>

<p>St. Antony, ready to <i>do his best</i> for God, did not
think of himself a bit. He just turned over in his
mind what would be the best thing to preach on so
as to help his brothers and bring honour and glory to
his God. By the time he was in the pulpit the Holy
Spirit had put a text into his mind. He gave it out
in his clear, ringing voice: "For us Christ became
obedient unto death, even the death of the cross."
Then he began to preach.</p>

<p>The Friars sat up and stared. The young, unknown
Friar was pouring forth a wonderful flood of eloquence,
full of the deepest thought, and showing such learning
as none of them possessed. Only a scholar could
preach like that; and only a scholar who was full of
the fire of the Holy Ghost could move the hearts of his
hearers as this man did!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>The Friars and their Superiors sat spellbound.
They quite forgot the preacher, and were carried away
by his words into a greater love of God. When at
last he ceased, and walked quietly down from the
pulpit, his eyes on the ground, deep humility in his
heart, his hearers turned to each other in wonder and
delight, and all said they had never heard such a
preacher in their lives.</p>

<p>Of course, the Superiors hurried off and told St.
Francis all about it, and you can imagine how delighted
St. Francis was to hear he had such a wonderful man
among his Friars. It ended in St. Francis sending
St. Antony to do what many years ago he had longed
to do&mdash;that is, preach to the heretics who were teaching
wrong things about the Christian Faith.</p>

<p>Still as humble as ever, St. Antony set out to tramp
along the roads to the places at which he was to
preach. Through Italy he went, and then France, and
then Spain, and back to Italy, and on these journeys
the most wonderful things happened. Not only did
God give him the power of preaching such marvellous
sermons that the people crowded in thousands to hear
him, but He gave him the power to do miracles, like
He once gave to His Apostles. As to the heretics,
they simply couldn't stand up against St. Antony, and
thousands of them either had to stop their false teaching
and keep quiet, or else were converted and came
over to St. Antony's side. Because of this he got the
name, "Hammer of Heretics."</p>

<p>But it wasn't only to the heretics he preached.
The ordinary people used to come in such crowds that
there simply wasn't room in the churches for them,
and St. Antony had to preach out in the fields and
plains. Rich and poor used to come, clergy and
ignorant peasants. The shopkeepers used to shut up
their shops. The people were so much moved by his
sermons that enemies forgave each other, men paid
their debts, or creditors forgave their debtors; wicked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
people gave up their sinful life, and started trying to
<i>do their best</i> to become pleasing to God.</p>

<p>One day a band of twelve brigands who lived in the
forest and robbed passers-by heard about the famous
preacher. So they disguised themselves, and went to
see if what was said of him was true. When he began
to preach he completely won their hearts, and they
repented of their sinful life. After the sermon they
spoke to St. Antony, and confessed what wicked men
they had been. He told them they must never go
back to their robber life, and he said that those who
gave it up would go some day to heaven, but that if
any went back to it they would have miserable ends.
And, sure enough, some who went back soon died
horrible deaths. St. Antony told them to try and do
something to make up for having been so wicked.
One of them, he said, was to go twelve times in pilgrimage
to the tomb of St. Peter and St. Paul at
Rome. Years and years after, when this robber was
an old, old man, he met a Friar on the road, and he
told him how when he was young he had heard
St. Antony preach, and how he had told him to go
to Rome twelve times. "And now I am on my way
back from Rome for the twelfth time," he said. That
shows you what power St. Antony had.</p>

<p>There's no time now to tell you of all the miracles
he did; but they were so wonderful that he came to
be called the "Wonder-worker," and it showed everyone
that God was with him.</p>

<p>And do you think all this honour and glory, and big
crowds running after him, and great men praising him,
made St. Antony proud or even the least bit pleased
with himself? No; he stayed just as humble and
retiring as he was in the days when he used to wash
dishes in the mountain friary.</p>

<p>But St. Antony's hard life was beginning to tell on
his health. For a long time he had secretly suffered
from a very painful disease. It was now about nine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
years since the day he preached his first sermon and
was sent forth by St. Francis on his great mission.
As the summer drew on St. Antony ceased to preach,
so as not to hinder the people's work in the vineyards.
Also, he knew the end of his life was near. He longed
for a little peace and solitude and silence; he longed
to be alone with God to prepare for his great journey
into the next world.</p>

<p>There was a nobleman called Count Tiso, who had
a beautiful estate not far from Padua, a city St. Antony
loved very much. Here St. Antony went for a time
of rest. There was no rocky hill-side to make a cave
which he might use as his cell, so he got Count Tiso
to make him a cell in the great branches of a walnut-tree.
These branches spread out not far above the
ground, and between them Count Tiso wove reeds and
willow twigs, and made a lovely little house for St.
Antony. The thick, leafy branches above sheltered
him from the hot sun; a few rough steps led up to it;
and here St. Antony could spend his days in complete
solitude.</p>

<p>But one evening when he had come down to have
his evening meal with his companions, in the little
friary near by, he was taken very ill, and his pain was
so great that he could no longer sit upright.</p>

<p>He knew he was soon to die, and he longed to die
at his beloved city, Padua. He was really much too
ill to be moved, but when his companions saw how
much he wanted this, they fetched a rough ox-cart
and laid St. Antony in it.</p>

<p>I told you how St. Antony had longed to share
Christ's sufferings and die a martyr's death&mdash;well,
now was his chance. He was in such frightful pain
that any tiny movement hurt him, and now he had
to go mile after mile in a rough cart with no springs,
jolting over the stony roads, the broiling Italian sun
beating down upon him, the thick white dust choking
his parched throat, the flies tormenting him. You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
can't imagine the agony he must have suffered. And
yet he never grumbled&mdash;he was <i>glad</i> of this chance of
suffering; he felt he was really taking up his cross and
following his beloved Master along the painful way
to Calvary.</p>

<p>When the cart had nearly reached Padua, a Friar
who had been sent to inquire after St. Antony met
the little procession. He saw at once that St. Antony
would not live to reach the city, so he made the Friars
lift him from the cart and carry him to a little house
of the Friars near by. It had been St. Antony's last
great wish to die at Padua; but even this he gave up
patiently and gladly and without a murmur.</p>

<p>In the little cell he lay, his pain getting worse and
worse, and his weakness greater and greater. The
Friars gave him the last rites of religion. "Then,
raising his eyes," the old book says, "he looked fixedly
on high. As he continued to gaze steadfastly towards
heaven, the Friars asked him what he saw. He
answered: 'I see my Lord.'"</p>

<p>Not long after, like one falling quietly asleep, he
breathed out his last breath. "His loving, holy soul
quitted the body, and, conducted by the good Jesus,
entered into the joy of his Lord."</p>

<p>The little cell where St. Antony died still stands, and
people can go in and look on the very walls his eyes
looked on, the very floor on which his body lay. It
is such a holy spot that a church has been built over
it, and the little square cell stands inside the church.</p>

<p>That is the story of one of the holiest and humblest
men who ever lived.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Very quietly the Cubs lay down on their palliasses,
and fell asleep thinking of their new friend, St. Antony.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE EIGHTH DAY</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>A pouring</span> day! Luckily the Cubs remained in the
sunny land of dreams till eight.</div>

<p>Meals had to be in the bell-tent. This was great fun!
There was just room for a council circle, only you had
to be careful not to put your feet in other people's
porridge, or let your head rub against the tent. If
you did, a stream of water soon began to run down
your neck, and Akela said it <i>served you right</i>.</p>

<p>Every now and then the rain <i>nearly</i> stopped, and
everybody dashed out for a few minutes; but no
sooner were you out, than the weather-fairy seemed
to say, "Yah! Sold again!" and down came another
sheet of rain that sent everyone scuttling for shelter.</p>

<p>The Cubs decided that it would be a good day to
have a concert, and that there might be a rehearsal in
the morning and the grand performance later on. So
they sat round and made a lovely row; and some
people sang some very pretty solos&mdash;but I will tell
you about them when I tell you about the grand
performance.</p>

<p>It cleared up for a little while before dinner, and the
Cubs went out for a search for dry wood. Some of
them went down to the shore, and there they found
some boys with donkeys and ponies for hire, so they
had some lovely rides up and down the sand, and no
one fell off. Just as they got home the rain started
again in torrents.</p>

<p>In the tent they found two visitors&mdash;old friends who
had once known them in London. This made them
think how lucky it was they had had a rehearsal, for
now they would be able to give the visitors a concert,
and then they would not be disappointed because of
the rain. So after dinner the concert began.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>First the whole Pack shouted the camp chorus&mdash;the
same one which I told you they sang in the train.
They then sang "John Peel." Then Bunny sang a
solo called "Hush thee, my Baby." This was followed
by a very pretty duet by Patsy and Mac&mdash;"'Tis the
Last Rose of Summer" (Mac sang the alto very well).
Then the whole Pack sang a song called "Robin
Hood," which Akela had once made up for them.
After that Bunny recited Brutus' speech from Shakespeare's
play, "Julius C&aelig;sar"&mdash;he made you feel he
really <i>was</i> Brutus, and everyone clapped him. Then
four Cubs sang "Annie Laurie," in parts. Then they
all made Spongey sing a song. Spongey was very
shy, and said he couldn't. But in the end he sang a
very short song, in a very deep voice, called, "Oh-oh-oh,
it's a Loverly War." Of course, everyone cheered
themselves hoarse.</p>

<p>Then the Pack sang "The Golden Vanity" right
through all its many verses. This was followed by
a solo from Mac&mdash;a sad little Irish song&mdash;and another
duet by Mac and Patsy, "When Irish Eyes are
Smiling," followed by "Oh Wert Thou in the Cauld
Blast," sung in parts by Jack, Patsy, and Mac. Then
everyone sang choruses.</p>

<p>The visitors enjoyed it very much.</p>

<p>By the end of the programme it was quite impossible
for the Cubs to sit still for another moment. You can't
get much exercise in a wet bell-tent. So Akela had
a bright idea. If you were <i>in</i> the sea the rain couldn't
wet you&mdash;what about a bathe? Everyone cheered,
and got into their coats and macs, and ran down to
the Stable, where they changed into their bathing
things. The sea felt awfully warm, and everyone
shrieked and splashed and made such a row that the
visitors, all shut up stuffy and cross in their lodgings,
looked out of their windows and wondered who <i>could</i>
be so cheerful on such a day.</p>

<p>Coming back to tea, the Cubs were delighted to find<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
their Scoutmaster sitting on the floor of the bell-tent,
a large bun in one hand and a mug of tea in the other.
He had tramped all the way over from Quarr to see
how far the whole camp had been drowned. In case
there were any survivors, he brought two enormous
bags of sweets.</p>

<p>That night all the Cubs prayed very hard for a real,
proper, hot day for their last in camp. It certainly
did not look possible. But Spongey put the matter
in a nutshell when he stood in his long night-shirt, one
eye shut as usual, and remarked: "I think it'll sunshine
to-morrer, 'cos I've prayed very hard it will."</p>

<p>The Cubs had turned in early, to get out of the wet
world into their dry, cosy beds. There was plenty of
time for a good long story, and they settled down with
wriggles of satisfaction and waited for Akela to begin.</p>


<h3><br /><span class="smcap">The Story of St. Patrick.</span></h3>

<p>Nearly four hundred years after Our Lord had gone
up to heaven, and left His disciples and their followers
to carry on, a boy was born who was destined to be
one of God's greatest Saints, and to bring thousands
and thousands of pagans into the Christian Faith.
This boy was St. Patrick, called the Apostle of Ireland,
because he turned the whole of Ireland Christian.
For many hundreds of years after St. Patrick had died,
Ireland was like a fruitful garden in which sprang up
hundreds of Saints and holy and learned men, who
helped to spread the knowledge and love of Christ all
over the world. So St. Patrick was truly an Apostle,
and, like St. John and St. Andrew and the others, one
of the foundation-stones of Christ's great Church.</p>

<p>But though he <i>ended</i> in being so very important, and
doing things that made a great difference to the whole
world, he <i>began</i> as an ordinary boy&mdash;and rather a
naughty one, as he tells us himself. We know a great
deal about St. Patrick, and we know it is quite true,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
because when he was over one hundred years old he
wrote it all down himself. He called the book his
"Confession," and though he told us such a lot about
himself, beginning with the adventures of his boyhood,
there is one thing he did not put down in the
book. Can you guess what? Well, he did not put
down how good he was. For, you see, the Saints
never thought themselves good, because, instead of
comparing themselves with people <i>less good than themselves</i>,
as we are all so fond of doing, they kept on
comparing themselves with Our Blessed Lord, and of
course, that made them seem very, very far from
perfect.</p>

<p>When St. Patrick was a boy he did not love God or
believe all his Christian teachers told him, nor was
he obedient or ready to <i>do his best</i>. One day some
fierce pirates raided the land where he lived with his
father and mother, and carried him off captive with
lots of other boys. Sailing across the sea to Ireland,
the pirates sold the boys as slaves.</p>

<p>St. Patrick was bought by a great chief called
Milcho, and sent out on to the hill-sides to watch the
sheep. Do you think he was lonely and afraid? No.
For, when torn away from his home, from the friends
who loved him, he had discovered that there is one
Friend that you can't be dragged away from, and Who
can be with you even in the midst of the tossing green
sea, on a pirate ship. For, though Patrick had forgotten
God, God had not forgotten Patrick. "The
Lord," he says, "showed me my unbelief, and had
pity on my youth and ignorance."</p>

<p>So when he trudged out on to the mountain-side, he
was not sad and alone, but glad in the knowledge that
his unseen Friend was with him.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Christ with me, Christ before me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Christ behind me, Christ in me,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Christ above me, Christ beneath me,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Christ in the chariot, Christ in the fort, Christ in the ship."</span><br />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>That is a prayer St. Patrick made up himself. There,
on the rough mountain-side, the boy St. Patrick spent
all his lonely days talking to God, so that, he says,
"more and more the love of God and His faith and
fear grew in me, and my spirit was stirred." He tells
us that he would recite one hundred prayers in one
day, and nearly as many in the night.</p>

<p>He had to sleep out with the sheep in some rough
cave or hut. "Before the dawn," he says, "I was
called to pray by the snow, the ice, and the rain." But
he did not mind this outward cold, because of the
burning heart within him.</p>

<p>St. Patrick had learnt his lesson&mdash;the lesson of where
to find the only comfort and friendship and help
worth having. God wanted him, now, for the great
work he was to do. One night a mysterious voice told
him that if he went to a certain place he would find a
ship ready to take him home. The place was about
two hundred miles away, and St. Patrick had never
been there. However, trusting in God's help, he
started off. At last, after a long tramp, he reached
the town, and, sure enough, there was a ship at the
quay about to set sail. St. Patrick asked to be taken
on board, but when the sailors heard he had no money
they refused him a passage. St. Patrick went sadly
away, but as he went he prayed. Before long he
heard someone coming after him. Turning round, he
found it was one of the sailors, who said after all they
would take him.</p>

<p>I can't tell you now of the adventures St. Patrick
had on his way home, but after being shipwrecked and
nearly starved, and each time wonderfully saved by
God, he reached his father's house. But though he
was home again with those he loved, he did not forget
the Friend Who had been his all in those cold, hard
days in Ireland. He thought of Him all day, and of
how best to please Him. He had already begun
studying for a life in God's service, when he had a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
wonderful vision of the people of Ireland calling him
to come to their help, and he knew it was a sign from
God that this was the work he was to do. You can
imagine how impatient he must have been to get a
ship and go sailing back to Ireland to tell the people
about the true God, and how Christ had died on the
Cross for them, and all the rest; but for such a difficult
and dangerous job he needed a lot of training&mdash;not
only in learning, but in the strength and holiness and
obedience to God which should make him able to face
the task before him. How long do you think God
kept him at his training? Thirty-eight years!</p>

<p>At the end of this time a holy man who was his
friend and guide was sent to preach in Britain. St.
Patrick went with him. This was the first step, and
it ended in his being made a Bishop and sent&mdash;at last&mdash;to
the lifework he had so long waited for, the conversion
of Ireland.</p>

<p>When St. Patrick's ship came to shore, the wild men
of Leinster would not let him land. So, trusting as
usual to God, he sailed out again to sea, and landed
a little farther to the south. There seemed to be
nobody about, to stop him; and, tired out, I suppose,
with a day of exploring in the strange land, St. Patrick
lay down and fell asleep. A little Irish boy chanced to
come along, and, seeing a stranger asleep, crept up
on tip-toe to look at him. What a lovely, kind face
he had! The boy thought to himself that he had
never before seen anybody who looked so nice, and
he longed to do him some good turn. He couldn't
think of anything to do for someone who was asleep,
but at last he got an idea. Picking all the best flowers
he could find, he put them round St. Patrick for a
surprise for him.</p>

<p>When St. Patrick woke up you can imagine how
pleased he was with the flowers, and still more pleased
to see a little Irish boy smiling at him shyly from
among the bushes. Before long St. Patrick and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
boy had become great friends, and the boy simply
wouldn't go away, but stuck to St. Patrick. Then
God made known a secret of the future to St. Patrick,
and he said: "Some day he will be the heir to my
kingdom." And, sure enough, the boy, whose name
was Benignus, succeeded St. Patrick as Bishop of
Armagh. Don't you wish you were that boy, always
to stay with St. Patrick?</p>

<p>After this the most wonderful adventures began to
befall St. Patrick; but even more wonderful than the
adventures were the miracles by which he managed to
escape out of them, not only alive, but victorious.</p>

<p>Getting into his ship again, St. Patrick landed
farther north. Once more the fierce Irish set on him
and his little band, and their chief, Dichu, raised his
sword to bring it crashing down on St. Patrick's head.
But, somehow, his arm stayed stiff in mid-air, and he
could not strike the blow. Dichu was an honest man,
and soon understood that such a miracle must be a
sign from the true God. If once you believe in God&mdash;well,
the only possible thing is to serve Him. So
Dichu became a Christian, and humbly learned from
St. Patrick how he should serve God.</p>

<p>Then St. Patrick went to the house of the very chief
who had kept him as a slave, and converted his children
to the true Faith. But it was at Easter that something
very thrilling happened, and was the beginning
of St. Patrick's real triumphs.</p>

<p>The Chief-King of Erin (as Ireland was called) was
just going to hold his solemn festival at Tara. All the
Irish princes and all the priests of the pagan religion
had collected together. One of their ceremonies was
the lighting of fire at dawn, with magic rites and ceremonies.
It happened to be Holy Saturday, and on
that day the Christians used to light a beacon. St.
Patrick lit his holy fire, as usual. The King saw it
blazing on a hill-top, and was very angry. One of his
priests (or Druids, as they were called) said: "If that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
fire is not put out before morning, it never will be put
out," and he meant the Christian Faith. So the King
sent for St. Patrick.</p>

<p>Surrounded by his Druids and bards, and all the
Irish princes, the King sat, fierce and proud, and
awaited the strangers. It was Easter morning, so, as
St. Patrick and his little band advanced, they chanted
the Easter litanies. So noble and holy did St. Patrick
look that one of the bards rose as he drew near. This
little act of politeness on the part of the bard brought
him special grace from heaven, and he accepted the
Christian Faith.</p>

<p>Standing quietly in the midst of the circle of priests
and princes, St. Patrick looked around him. He met
countless pairs of fierce eyes fixed upon him, as the
princes sat in silence, "with the rims of their shields
against their chins"; and as he looked at them he
longed to win them all for God, and he prayed for
grace and power to do what was needed. Then he
told them why he had come to Ireland.</p>

<p>The King left his Druids to reply. They did so by
doing all sorts of horrible magic. And certainly they
made things happen, much as people called "spiritists"
do nowadays; but it was not by God's power, so it
must have been the Devil who helped them. Whatever
the Druids did, St. Patrick undid, and then did something
more wonderful. The Druids were furious, and
no one knows what might have happened had not
St. Patrick caused an earthquake to happen, by God's
power. So terrified were the Irish that they went half
mad and began killing each other, and St. Patrick and
his men escaped.</p>

<p>But the next day St. Patrick boldly came back,
though he knew the King meant to kill him. He was
given a cup of poisoned wine to drink. Well, what of
that? Did not Our Lord say to His disciples, when
He sent them out to convert the world, "If you drink
any deadly thing it shall not hurt you"? St. Patrick<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
made the sign of the cross over the cup and drank it,
and nothing happened.</p>

<p>Then the Druids arranged a horrible test. They
laid two great fires, one of dry faggots and the other
of wet, green wood. On the dry wood they laid the
boy Benignus, dressed in a Druid's white robe. On
the green they put a Druid, clad in St. Patrick's
cloak. Then they said they would set fire to both piles.
St. Patrick accepted the challenge. (If you had been
the boy, would you have "got the wind up," do you
think, or would you have trusted St. Patrick?)</p>

<p>Well, they set fire to the two piles of wood. Strange
to say, the green wood blazed up, with many sizzlings
and cracklings and much smoke, but the dry wood
simply wouldn't light. There was, however, a sudden
flame, and the Druid's robe on the boy flared up and
was soon burnt to ashes, leaving Benignus quite all
right, and, I expect, very pleased with himself!
Meanwhile, horrible noises had been coming from the
other pile, and when the smoke and flames died down
there were only charred cinders where there had once
been a Druid. But St. Patrick's cloak had not been
burnt at all.</p>

<p>As the King still would not believe, St. Patrick had
to make another earthquake happen, which swallowed
up so many of the King's subjects that he gave in,
and said St. Patrick might preach, though he himself
never accepted the Faith.</p>

<p>So, on the green plains of Tara, St. Patrick preached
a wonderful sermon to the Irish, who by this time had
come crowding round to see the stranger who could
beat the Druids at their own game. During this
sermon St. Patrick stooped down and picked a leaf
of shamrock, and, holding it up, showed the people
how the little green leaf was <i>three</i> and yet <i>one</i>. He
said that would help them to understand how the
Blessed Trinity is three&mdash;God the Father, God the Son,
and God the Holy Ghost&mdash;and yet is really only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
<i>one God</i>. That is why the Irish wear shamrock on
St. Patrick's Day (March 17th).</p>

<span style="margin-left: 9em;"><a href="#Page_101"><i>See page 101.</i></a></span>
</div>


<p>Many more miracles did St. Patrick which I can't
tell you about now; and he went from place to place,
winning thousands of men for Christ, and giving
spiritual life to their souls by baptizing them.</p>

<p>One Shrove Tuesday St. Patrick went up on to the
top of a lonely, rugged mountain above the sea, and
there he stayed without any food all through Lent till
Easter. And all the time he prayed and prayed and
prayed for the men of Ireland and their fate on the
Judgment Day. At the end of his long and painful
time of prayer God sent an angel to tell him his request
was granted. So, with his heart full of joy, St. Patrick
knelt and blessed Ireland, and as he gave his blessing
hundreds of poisonous snakes came out of their holes
and went slithering away into the sea, where they
were all drowned. (That is why you see pictures of
St. Patrick with snakes.) And now, every year,
thousands of Irish people go on pilgrimage up that
mountain.</p>

<p>Before I end I must just tell you one little story
about a young Irish Prince who <i>didn't give in to himself</i>.
This Prince and his followers, after hearing
St. Patrick preach, decided to become followers of Christ
and be baptized. St. Patrick, being a Bishop, carried
a thing called a crozier&mdash;a kind of long staff, like
a shepherd's crook, because <i>Bishop</i> means <i>shepherd</i>.
St. Patrick's crozier had rather a sharp point at the end,
and during the ceremony of Baptism, somehow, by
accident, he pierced the Prince's bare foot with it, but
did not notice what he had done. The Prince said
nothing, and did not wince or seem surprised. Afterwards,
when St. Patrick found out what he had done,
and asked the Prince why he had said nothing, the
Prince replied: "I thought it was the rule of faith."
A bit of poetry has been written about it, which puts
it rather nicely. The Prince says, in it:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
"I thought, thus called to follow Him Whose Feet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Were pierced with nails, haply the blissful rite</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Some little pain included."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Everywhere St. Patrick went he was loved, and soon
the fame of him had spread through the whole country.
The superstitious religion of the Druids altogether died
down, and Ireland became a Christian country.
St. Patrick made a set of wise laws, and by these the
Irish were governed for a thousand years.</p>

<p>At last came the time when his great work was
finished. The little boy, Benignus, had grown up and
taken over St. Patrick's work. St. Patrick had written
his "Confession." And now, at one hundred and
twenty, he was quite ready for the rest and the reward
of heaven. He was very happy; his great work had
been accomplished. God had been very good to him.
And so, satisfied, he lay down to die, knowing that all
the men of Ireland were praying for their beloved
father.</p>

<p>So, on March 17th, in the year 493, St. Patrick
passed from this world into the glory of Heaven.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE NINTH DAY</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>As</span> the Cubs one by one opened their eyes on the last
day at camp, the first thing they saw was that their
prayers of last night had been fully, <i>wonderfully</i>
answered. The sun shone with that clear golden
radiance of early morning sun. The sky was a misty
blue, with just a few small "flocks of sheep." The
wind had dropped, and the world, washed clean by
the rain, was going to enjoy itself to-day.</div>

<p>Quickly the Cubs washed themselves and scrambled
into their old clothes, and were away up to the field
in record time. The smell of wood smoke; the cry of
the sea-gulls; the <i>bigness</i> of God's beautiful world&mdash;only
one more day of it all!</p>

<p>Porridge out in the sunshine, and lots and lots of
bread-and-jam. Then down to the shore.</p>

<p>On the way shorewards the Cubs met a kind lady
who lived in the little house at the end of the sea-wall.
She had often seen them run past, and now she stopped
and asked Akela what they were. When she heard it
was their last day she said they might have her boat
for the whole morning!</p>

<p>So the Cubs and Akela all got into their bathing
things, and the boat was rowed round from where it
was anchored to the bit of the shore where they always
played. When everyone had been out and had
learnt to row, first with one oar and then with two;
and when the tide had gone down, down, down, as far
as it could, Akela anchored the boat in shallow water,
and took away all the oars but one. Then the Cubs
had a gorgeous time, rowing by themselves, as far as
the long rope would allow. I don't know what that
boat turned into&mdash;pirate vessels, the <i>Golden Hind</i>, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
everything else you can imagine, while the gallant crew
had many an adventure.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <i>another</i> kind lady had appeared on the
scene. She lived in a nice house, with a very sloping
lawn in front, and her garden steps came right down
on to the bit of sand where the Cubs always played.
She came down and offered a prize for the best little
house or model village or garden the Cubs could make.
Four couples set to work, and by dinner-time there
were some splendid models ready. Then "Big Andy
and Little Andy," clad only in their bathing-drawers,
walked demurely up to the front-door of the house, and
asked the lady to come and see. She came out carrying
two lovely spades, two splendid shrimping-nets, and
two very nice rubber balls.</p>

<p>She decided the "Andies" had got first prize; they
had made a model of Quarr Abbey; Sam and Dick
were second, with a church; while Bert and Bunny
came in a good third, with a very nice house standing
in a large and luxurious garden. After giving the
prizes, this fairy godmother invited the whole Pack
to tea in her garden, at four o'clock, after the afternoon
bathe!</p>

<p>So, after dinner, they went to the Stable and made
themselves a little bit respectable, and then down to
the shore and bathed, and afterwards went up the
smooth, steep lawn to the fairy godmother's house.</p>

<p>Soon a maid brought out tea; and it was <i>some</i>
tea&mdash;cake of all sorts, and real bread-and-butter
(not "marg."), and little jam-sandwiches (but, as
one Cub remarked, "it didn't <i>fill you up</i>, like camp-tea").</p>

<p>After tea, during which the Cubs were wonderfully
quiet and well-behaved, they entertained their hostess
with various kinds of somersaults and cart-wheels, and
then went through a large part of the famous concert
for her benefit. Before going they gave her a Grand
Howl, and then all shook hands with her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>After that they played on the shore, and then ended
up with a last bathe, about seven.</p>

<p>Back to supper. Camp prayers for the last time in
the soft evening light. Good-night to Father and
Mother and Godmother; and then to the Stable, for
the last story.</p>

<p>But as they squatted round waiting for the story,
someone made a remark that was the beginning of
quite a long pow-wow. "Miss," he said, "shall we
be Cubs in <i>Heaven</i>, and will you be our Cubmaster?"</p>

<p>Everyone had questions to ask about Heaven&mdash;more
than Akela knew how to answer! And then they
grew serious as someone mentioned two Cubs who
had died a year before. "Do you think Frank and
Bob have found each other in heaven?" "Yes," said
Akela, "I'm sure they have; and I expect they've
found those two Cubs from two other Westminster
Packs, who died of 'flu, last winter."</p>

<p>And that is why this book is dedicated to Frank and
Bob, for they were two of the most faithful Cubs who
ever lived. They died brave and unselfish&mdash;Bob after
a long and very painful illness, in which he never <i>gave
in to himself</i>, but was always thinking of other people
and his "little 'uns." At last, as he lay delirious, he
used to think he was in camp again, and say: "Oh,
mother, look at the green fields&mdash;aren't they lovely?"
And as Akela knelt by his bed, holding his poor little
hot hand, she felt sure that soon he would be playing
in the green fields of Heaven&mdash;the best camp of all,
where the Good Shepherd was already waiting to carry
him in His strong, kind arms.</p>

<p>And now someone else had a splendid idea: "Perhaps
they've talked to the Saints!"</p>

<p>"<i>We</i> shall know a lot of the Saints when <i>we</i> go to
Heaven," said another Cub; "<i>I</i> shall look out for
St. Antony first."</p>

<p>And so they decided to try and get to know as many
Saints as possible before they died, <i>and to try and copy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
them</i>, so that some day they would find lots of friends
in Heaven, who would not be ashamed to receive the
salutes of their little brothers, and to return them
with kind smiles of welcome.</p>

<p>Then the Cubs settled down for a last story.</p>


<h3><br /><span class="smcap">The Story of St. George.</span></h3>

<p>"And now," said the Cubs, "a last story! Go on,
Miss&mdash;make it an <i>extra</i> good one, exciting and full of
adventures, and the best of all, because it's the last
night."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Akela, "I'll tell you the story of
the Patron Saint of all Cubs and Scouts, and of England.
Who's that?"</p>

<p>"St. George!" cried the Cubs in chorus. And
although many of them knew the story very well, they
snuggled down in their blankets and prepared to enjoy
themselves.</p>

<p>Well (said Akela), I'm going to tell you the story of
the Saint who was more thought about and honoured
in the old days than, perhaps, any other Saint who
ever lived. He was from the very earliest times&mdash;in
fact, from directly after his death&mdash;called "the Great
Martyr." He became the patron of many countries
and orders of knighthood, but specially in England
was he loved, and his feast was kept as a great holiday,
equal to Christmas. Already, before William the
Conqueror came to England, our forefathers had begun
to build churches in honour of St. George. But it was
King Richard C&#339;ur de Lion who specially spread
devotion to St. George in England, because he took
him as his own patron, and used his name as his
battle-cry. "For God and St. George!" he would
shout, as he swung his mighty battle-axe in the air
and charged at the head of his knights toward the
Saracen lines.</p>

<p>St. George several times appeared on a white horse,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
and led the Crusaders to victory when it seemed as
if the enemy were going to put them to flight and come
off victorious.</p>

<p>Many people think of St. George as a knight on a
prancing horse, who killed a dragon and rescued a
maiden in distress. But this is only a kind of parable
or picture of the real St. George and what he did. The
dragon is a picture of the wicked, heathen religion that
tried to kill the beautiful young Church that Our Lord
had made. St. George fought this dragon, and gave
his life in the battle, but he rescued the maiden (who
represents the Church); for his death seems to have
rallied the Christians and filled them with new courage
to fight bravely and stick to it, until at last the heathen
dragon was overcome, and the Church of Christ was
able to fill all the world with joy and truth and light.</p>

<p>Well, now I will tell you what the old books say
about St. George; but we have not many details about
his life, as we have about St. Francis's.</p>

<p>St. George lived a bit more than three hundred
years after Christ. He was the son of a Roman
soldier, a Christian, stationed in Palestine, which was
a Roman colony. St. George was one of those brave,
straightforward boys who are afraid of nothing&mdash;neither
of themselves and their weakness, nor of other
people and their unkindness. He practised "not
giving in to himself," like a good Cub; and he thought
a great deal of his <i>honour</i>, like a good Scout. And he
knew that everything brave or good that he ever did
was by the grace of his Captain, Christ, and not because
he was any better himself than anybody else. He
could ride well, shoot an arrow straight, and use a
spear or a broadsword as well as any Roman boy.
But it was not so much this as his way of obeying
quickly, and keeping his word, and never giving in to
himself, which made him rise from promotion to
promotion when he joined the Roman army.</p>

<p>He was still very young when he was made what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
we should now call a Colonel, and given a great deal
of responsibility. In fact, the Emperor thought no end
of him, and people whispered that some day he would
be head of the army and one of the most important
men in the Roman Empire. This was rather wonderful,
because the Emperor, Diocletian, was a heathen
and hated Christians, and, as I told you, St. George
was a very good Christian.</p>

<p>In those days the Christian Church was no longer
hiding in the Catacombs, but had come out into the
open, and nearly half Diocletian's Empire was Christian.
But something&mdash;probably pride&mdash;made Diocletian hate
the Christians, and he decided to do all he could to
destroy the Church of Christ, and force the people back
into the old religion, and worship a god that was really
not very different from C&aelig;sar, the Emperor, himself.</p>

<p>So he first tried burning down the churches, and
then imprisoning the priests and bishops. But one
day he suddenly got mad, and gave an order that if
the people would not worship the Roman gods and
offer incense to them, and swear that they no longer
believed in Christ, his soldiers would kill them like
beasts and leave them in the streets, as a ghastly
warning to any other fools who refused to obey.</p>

<p>So the soldiers went forth, sword in hand, and every
man, woman, and child who refused to give up Christ
was killed, or wounded and left to bleed to death.</p>

<p>Now, no one had thought that Diocletian would
ever go as far as this, and when the horrible news was
brought to St. George he was filled with rage. The
Emperor was, of course, his master, but there and then
he vowed that he would not stay in the service of a
vile murderer, a coward who could stain his sword
with the blood of women and little children; and he
prepared at once to go to the Emperor, and say straight
out all that was burning in his heart.</p>

<p>Now, his friends knew that nothing would more
enrage the Emperor than this, because he thought a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
lot of St. George, and yet he was proud and obstinate,
and nothing would make him stop persecuting the
Christians. If St. George spoke as he said he would,
it would certainly mean <i>no chance of promotion</i>, no
becoming head of the army; perhaps, even, it would
mean imprisonment; possibly death. So they simply
<i>begged</i> St. George not to go. But do you think he
was that sort? Not much! The last thing he wanted
was promotion in the army of a man who was the
cruel enemy of Christ and the murderer of his fellow-Christians.
So he set spurs to his horse, and rode off
for the Emperor's Court.</p>

<p>Diocletian was surprised to see him arrive suddenly,
travel-stained and apparently in a great hurry; and
still more was he surprised when, instead of speaking
with reverence and respect, he let the words almost
burst forth from his full heart, and told the Emperor
that it would be better if he paid honour to the God
from Whom he had received his sceptre, instead of
murdering the faithful servants of that God.</p>

<p>Diocletian was first surprised and then angry. But
he tried to laugh it off, because he was really fond of
St. George. Then he tried reasoning with the young
soldier, and explaining that he had to keep the
Christians in good discipline in case they might revolt
or get proud and rebellious. But St. George would listen
to no reasons or excuses, and, unbuckling his sword,
he laid it down, resigning his commission in the army
of a man who could act so dishonourably.</p>

<p>Then Diocletian got very angry indeed. He gave
orders that St. George should be put in a dark dungeon,
and loaded with chains until his pride should be broken,
and he should be willing to humble himself before the
Emperor. So angry was he that he made up his cruel
mind that now he would even force St. George to give
up the Christian religion himself, and that no pains
should be spared to make him do this.</p>

<p>Alone in the dark, dank, icy-cold dungeon, St. George<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
lay in his heavy chains, and wondered what was going
to happen next. It was very horrible, down there, and
he ached in every limb, and he was very hungry; but
somehow he felt kind of glad inside, because he knew
he was suffering all this for Christ's sake.</p>

<p>One day, when his gaoler brought him his ration of
hard bread, he told him that he had heard a rumour
that the executioner was coming to the dungeon, and
that if St. George did not give a satisfactory answer
he would be put to torture. The gaoler said it would,
he thought, be a very painful kind of torture, and St.
George had better be reasonable.</p>

<p>When he had gone St. George sat in the darkness
with his heart beating rather fast. He wondered what
sort of torture it would be, and if he would be able
to stick it. Then he remembered that Our Lord had
suffered awful tortures, and had foretold that His
friends would have to, as well. So he asked Our Lord
to give him grace to be able to stick <i>anything</i> the
Emperor should do, and then he felt quite happy again.</p>

<p>Well, the hours dragged by, and at last St. George
heard the tramp of feet on the stone stairs. Then there
was a creak as the great key was turned in the lock,
and bolts were shot back. The door opened, and there
stood the executioner and two soldiers, one carrying
a lantern.</p>

<p>The executioner, who had known St. George as a
Colonel in the army, spoke respectfully. He gave St.
George a message from the Emperor, saying that if he
would come back and offer incense to the gods, and
apologize for his proud words, he would get his liberty
and be given back his commission. St. George laughed,
and said he certainly wouldn't. Then the executioner
said that in that case the Emperor had commanded
that he should be tortured till he agreed to do all he
was told.</p>

<p>The soldiers loosened his chains, and he was led out
and up the stairs. The blazing, blinding sun dazzled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
his eyes after the dimness of the dungeon. The pavement
of the courtyard seemed burning to his cold, bare
feet. Soldiers looked curiously at him as he passed,
but of course didn't salute, now. He was taken away
to the horrible place of execution, and there a new form
of torture was applied to him&mdash;a great wheel full of
spikes into which he was thrust. When he was dragged
out his body was one mass of wounds, and his blood
dripped down on to the floor. He was carried on a
stretcher back to the dungeon; and the executioner felt
quite sure that when he was well enough to answer he
would agree to do anything the Emperor wanted.</p>

<p>St. George was dazed with pain and loss of blood.
His body seemed to burn all over. The darkness made
his eyes ache, and he lay hour after hour, wondering
how soon he would die. He had got to the point when
he thought he simply couldn't bear another moment,
when he heard a Voice in the darkness, and It said:
"Fear not, George, for I am with thee."</p>

<p>His heart seemed to leap up, for he knew for certain
that it was Our Lord's Voice&mdash;he could not possibly
mistake it. And suddenly all the pain seemed a
thousand times worth while, and he was glad he had
had it; and he didn't feel lonely any more; and he just
lay in the darkness and talked to Our Lord, knowing
that He was near. And he forgot his pain.</p>

<p>Well, when a Roman officer came to receive his
message to the Emperor St. George was able to laugh&mdash;rather
weakly this time&mdash;and say he had no message
for the Emperor, except that he had better stop
murdering Christians, and beg God's mercy before it
was too late.</p>

<p>The officer thought St. George was rather a fool, and
a very brave man, and he went back to the Emperor.</p>

<p>A few days later the executioner arrived once more,
and again led St. George across the sunny courtyard.
St. George remembered the Voice of Christ saying, "I
am with thee," and he was not afraid. This time they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
rolled a great heavy stone over his body, so that his
bones were crushed and bruised, and then they carried
him back to the dungeon.</p>

<p>When the officer came for his answer he could hardly
believe that St. George dared still to refuse. He told
the Emperor what St. George had said. The Emperor
was surprised and sorry, for he saw that St. George
must be a very brave man. He also saw that it was
no good waiting any longer, or trying to force him, so
he sent the executioner once again.</p>

<p>This time the executioner told St. George that his
last chance had come. Either he must give up Christ,
or he must face death. The words sent a kind of thrill
through St. George&mdash;a thrill of horror at the thought
of death, which turned into a thrill of joy at the
thought of going into the presence of Christ, and
hearing His wonderful Voice again, only this time
seeing Him, too. And he rejoiced, also, to think he
would really be a <i>martyr</i>. So he whispered faintly&mdash;for
he could hardly speak now&mdash;that nothing in all
the world would make him give up Christ.</p>

<p>So the soldiers took off his chains and dragged him
up to his feet, and he walked slowly, with weak,
swaying steps, into the sun.</p>

<p>"Fear not." He said the words over to himself.
No, he wouldn't fear! "I am with thee." How
wonderful! "And soon," he said in his heart, "<i>I</i>
shall be with <i>Thee</i>!" And so he knelt down and
waited.</p>

<p>And the executioner's great axe flashed in the sun
as he swung it aloft, and the next instant the blood of
"the Great Martyr" was streaming across the white
pavement, as St. George's Cross streams scarlet across
the white ground of his flag.</p>

<p>The soul of "the Great Martyr" had entered Heaven,
where the angels rejoiced at his coming, when the
Christians picked up his poor, broken body and carried
it away. It was buried in a beautiful tomb, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
before long a great church had been built over it.
On every hand people talked of "the Great Martyr,"
and the Christians rejoiced at his courage, and cheered
each other on to resist bravely. Many of the heathen,
seeing that St. George could suffer tortures and die for
his faith, began to believe in the Christ he loved, and
were baptized. Diocletian himself began to fear a
little, and the butchering stopped.</p>

<p>And so it was that the maiden in distress, the persecuted
Church of Christ, was saved by her brave
knight, St. George.</p>

<h2>GOOD-BYE</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>A grey</span> morning, but quite fine. Some of the Cubs
went off to bathe after breakfast, others to do final
shopping and buying of presents to take home, while
some stayed in the field to help with the packing.
The tent was struck and rolled up, swings and hammocks
taken down, palliasses emptied and done up in
bales, and by twelve o'clock all was finished, and the
time came to change out of the comfy old camp clothes
into full uniform. How tight and hot boots and
stockings seemed!</div>

<p>After dinner the Cubs gathered round into the
council circle. Everyone was feeling rather quiet.
Akela had a short pow-wow, and then the Cubs
squatted and let off a mighty Grand Howl, as a "thank
you" to everyone concerned for the glorious time
they had had, and as a sign that they were going back
to London meaning to <i>do their best</i> as never before.</p>

<p>Then they fell in, two deep, and, with a last look at
the field, marched away.</p>

<p>There was plenty of time before the boat was due
to sail from Ryde, so, after marching smartly through
the village, they fell out and strolled along the wall
or the seashore. On reaching Ryde they fell in again,
and halted near the fountain, two at a time falling out
for drinks. At Smith's bookstall Akela bought a
supply of "comics" to read in the train.</p>

<p>On board the ship an adventure happened. Big
Andy <i>of course</i> dropped his cap overboard. The sea was
rather rough and it seemed as if the cap must be lost,
two stars and all. It was too far down to reach with
the ship's mop or any stick. But luckily some thoughtful
Cub had brought a long piece of string with an
open safety-pin on the end, in hopes of catching a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
fish on the crossing. With this the cap was fished
for, while the people on the pier and the first-class
passengers on the upper deck looked on with eager
interest. Akela thought there was no hope of ever
seeing the cap again on Andy's head. She little knew
that two pious Cubs were busy <i>praying</i>! Presently
the cap was triumphantly pulled up, amidst cheers
from the pier and the upper deck.</p>

<p>"I prayed he'd get it!" cried a Cub.</p>

<p>"And so did I!" exclaimed another.</p>

<p>At Portsmouth there was a terrible crush for the
train, but, as usual, the Cubs did well, for the kind
guard gave them two first-class compartments and
locked them in.</p>

<p>And so they travelled back to dear, smoky old
London, very much browner and a good deal fatter
than when they set out.</p>
